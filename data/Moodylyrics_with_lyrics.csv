ML8,Austra,Spellwork,"[Verse 1]
Habit alone, when separate I moan
Feeding on bones or anything grown
I command post and nobody shows
In mornings I rest here
In evenings I work here
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left
All I adore...

[Chorus]
You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

[Verse 2]
I work alone saving my soul
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face
My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion
Spellwork and lies!

[Chorus]
You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire"
ML9,Coro,Can't Let You Go,"Yeah

I shoulda known you'd be this way
Serves me right to fall in love

You brought me love then you took it back
We had it all and that's a fact
Love is a game that we all play
There's one thing I've got to say

I gave you my heart and I gave you my world
I spent those lonely nights right here in the cold
Every time you touch me, my body starts to quiver
All I wanna do is love you all night long

Can't let you go, my love, it's you that I need
You keep me wanting you, you push my love aside
Can't let you go, my love, it's you that I need
You keep me wanting you, you push my love aside

I can't help but think of how you made me feel
Every time I think about the two of us

Can't realize (can't realize)
Can't seem to buy it (can't seem to buy it)
Now that you're gone (now that you're gone)
Now that you're gone

Can't let you go, my love, it's you that I need
You keep me wanting you, you push my love aside
Can't let you go, my love, it's you that I need
You keep me wanting you, you push my love aside

Can't let you go, my love
You fit me like a glove
'Cause when you hold me tight
The feeling's oh-so right
Just can't forget those times
When you were mine, all mine
This love I have for you is true
So come back to the one who loves you

Every time you touch me, my body starts to quiver
All I wanna do is love you all night long

I shoulda known that you'd be this way
Serves me right to fall in love
I can't help but think of how you left me feeling
Every time I think about the two of us

Can't realize (can't realize)
Can't seem to buy it (can't seem to buy it)
Now that you're gone (now that you're gone)

""how could He love me
I have sinned against Your will""
But He said, ""repent and I will forgive you
The question's who will you serve?""

You may even have lost your will to live;

Above the clouds were cliffs
Above the clouds were cliffs
Above the clouds were cliffs
Love moves through me
And into the abyss

Where'd all the time go?
It's starting to fly
See how the hands go
Waving goodbye
And you know I get so forgetful
When I look in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Now she's walking backwards (She's walking backwards)
Through a parade
And I'm stuck in the shadow (Stuck in the shadow)
Blocking the shade
And there ain't no way to sweep up (Ooh)
The mess that we've made

[Chorus]
She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed
Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow
She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes
And when the fog rises
Somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore

[Verse 3]
There's nothing to keep you (Nothing to keep you)
From falling in love
It starts at the bottom (Starts at the bottom)
And comes from above
Like pieces of a puzzle
Like a hand in a glove

[Chorus]
She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed
Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow
She'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes
And when the tide rises
Somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye
(Woo, woo)

Somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye"

Oh, how I wanna go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cottonfields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear, old papa, sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I wanna go home, I wanna go home, oh, how I wanna go home

Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars, by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines

Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones, the ones that I left waitin' so far behind

I wanna go home, I wanna go home
Oh, how I wanna go home..."

Once I had every reason a man could want
For going home and making love, but now I don't
So I end up in here each night sitting and a-thinking
Missing her, hurting so and drinking

Got no reason now for goin' home
All my reason's now she is gone
Got no one there to talk to
And even though I know I ought to
Got no reason now for goin' home

That she's out with him knowing that I love her

Raining on us
There was a phantom here
In a bed of love

Raining on us
There was a phantom here
In a bed of love

Where is the love, where is the love you promised me?
Where is the love, where is the love you promised me?

You're hiding your love from me, woo-hoo

ML37,Mavis Staples,You Are Not Alone,"You are not alone
I'm with you

Every night
I stand in your place
Every tear
On every face
Tastes the same
A broken dream
A broken heart
Isolated and afraid

You're not alone

An open hand
An open heart
There's no need to be afraid
Open up this is a raid

Are you ready?

[Verse 1: Jonathan Davis]
There's a place inside my mind
A place I like to hide

You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Another place I'll find
To escape the pain inside

[Refrain: Jonathan Davis]
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind, blind

[Bridge: Jonathan Davis]
Deeper and deeper and deeper
As I dream to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner
Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go
In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind?
This time I look to see what's between the lines

[Pre-Chorus: Jonathan Davis]
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

ML41,Megadeth,Angry Again,"[Verse 1]
The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

[Chorus]
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

[Verse 2]
And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

[Chorus]
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

[Bridge]
The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

[Chorus]
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again, and again and again, again

[Outro]
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry"
ML42,Ra,Do You Call My Name,"(Kill me with a beat)

[Verse 1]
Some people seem to think
They always know what's best for you
Their little minds try to
Create a world to keep you still
The bolt is thrown, the cage is locked
You saw this, don't you lie
At first you cry and then
You hate those people, stole your will

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(No nothing)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
So you just sit there stuck
Afraid to risk reality
Afraid to cause yourself
More pain to face insanity
But nothing ventured, nothing gained
You see your fear's your cage
You beg for help but
You're alone stuck in a helpless rage

[Pre-Chorus]
Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario

[Bridge]
It's me...
I see...
Please...
(Let me out, I'm petrified)

Do as you are told
And maybe then we'll let you out
You might be dead and cold
You might be full of doubt
Don't try to escape
Cause you don't have nowhere to go
If nothing is your fate
There's no scenario
(C'mon)

[Chorus]
Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore

Do you call my name
Do you stain my brain
My eyes are blurry and I can't see you anymore
Do you call my name
Do you breed my pain
My heart is bloody and I can't take it anymore"

You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (Feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane, they tell ya

Help you with your complications!""

They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal

And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah

Everybody to fear

Down inside a grave
Listen to the eulogy

Ever dance beside the devil
Taste the barrel of a gauge
Ever pull the trigger
The light begins to fade

I've asked you for your grace
I've asked you for your blessing
I've asked that I be saved

Stand in the corner and scream with me

A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fuckin' lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm goin' blind
And I smell like shit

Barred indoors from the summer street

But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fuckin' lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise

Pure black looking clear, my work is done soon here
Try getting back to me, get back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in, let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain, your loss becomes my gain

Anger, misery, you'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)

To see into my eyes, you'll find where murder lies

ML55,Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"[Spoken Intro: Strother Martin]
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

[Bridge]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said, ""Peace could last forever""?
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't wanna hear no more

[Verse 3]
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

[Chorus]
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I don't need one more war
Ooh, I don't need one more war
No, no, no,, no woah, no woah

[Outro]
What's so civil 'bout war anyway?"
ML56,Shadows Fall,King Of Nothing,"It was gone before you ever had a chance
Lost forever in your disapproving glance

I see your face
It's twisted with shock
Falling from grace
You deserve what you got

The ice surrounds you now

You can't pretend
All that you want
I've seen the pain
And all the evil you brought

Quit your fucking crying
And swallow all your pills
Your not the only one
With the urge to kill
Grab the dusty bottle
And let the liquor spill
Devoid of life
Death is your final thrill

Bloodshot eyes
Can see right through the selfish lies
Search forever for a fix that keeps you high

I see your face
It's twisted with shock
Falling from grace
You deserve what you got

My hands around your throat

You can't pretend
All that you want
I've seen the pain
And all the evil you brought

I am the king of nothing
Over emptiness I reign
Drown the sorrow
Wash away the pain"
ML57,Comeback Kid,Do Yourself A Favor,"I want to know how the story goes
And if the sad song writes about how much you know
About what really happened, obviously
You've got a skewed view or you weren't present to see

With a healthy dose of evident
Fabrication filling us in
I want to know where you're coming from
And where you're going
Have you come undone?
There's a vitamin in this tune
Step back a little bit
Give yourself room

When you say, when you say how it used to be
Understand I don't need the waste following me
When you say, when you say how it used to be
Understand I don't need the waste following me
When you say, when you say how it used to be
Understand I don't need the waste following me

Winding
It up
Twist it
Undone

Twist it
Undone

When you say, when you say
I want to know how the story goes

I want to know where you're coming from

Step back a little bit
Give yourself room

Understand I don't need the waste following me
When you say, when you say how it used to be

When you say, when you say how it used to be
Understand I don't need the waste following me

Shriek the lips across ragged tongue

It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin

Another fuse uncovered now for me to light

Making yourself a list of the things you wish you didn't say
Sitting by the phone hoping it's gonna ring

[Chorus]
Tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely getting by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely

Sometimes you're up all night crying over me
You've gotta take off of work to catch up on your sleep
But that just don't work, now does it, baby

So tell me you get lonely when it's cold outside
Tell me that you're only barely getting by
I need to know it hurts every time that you hear my name
It ain't the same without me, girl
Tell me you get lonely

[Bridge]
Tell me you get lonely, and I'll come back
All you've gotta do is call me, my bag's been packed
I'm dying of pride, but I want you to know

That I get lonely when it's cold outside
Baby, I'm only barely getting by
And it still hurts every time that I hear your name
It ain't the same without you, girl

Yeah, I get lonely
Tell me you get lonely, too
Tell me you get lonely"

But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

But I want to go home, I've got to go home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

Knock me down, it's all in vain

Why don't you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Well you're the real tough cookie with a long history
Of breaking little hearts like the one in me
Before I put another notch in my lipstick case

Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

At the stations - one by one

On his hands and knees

ML102,Billy Squier,In The Dark,"Life isn't easy from the singular side
Down in the hole, some emotions are hard to hide
It's your decision, it's a chance that you take
It's on your head, it's a habit that's hard to break

Do you need a friend?
Would you tell no lies?
Would you take me in?
Are you lonely in the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?

You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide
You're never sure if the illusion is real
You pinch yourself, but the memories are all you feel

Can you break away
From your alibis?
Can you make a play?
Oh, will you meet me in the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?

Don'tcha need me? Hey, hey
Don'tcha need me? Oh yeah
Don'tcha leave me, hey, hey
Don'tcha need me? Oh yeah

You take no interest, no opinion's too dear
You make the rounds, oh, you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes, and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene

Can you face the fire
When you see me there?
Can you feel the fire?
Will you love me in the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?
In the dark?"

ML111,Fiji,Anything You Want,"It's hard to explain
The hardships and pain
That true lovers must endure
That's for sure
I have my regrets
But much more than that
This special love we must secure
More and more

There's no better feelin'
Than when I rise up to see the morning sun
And watch the sunrise in you eyes
You're like the summer breeze
When I'm going through my winter time
So baby take this love of mine

'Cause anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will be so true
Anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will always be true to you

They say once you're bit, you're twice as shy
I have no reason to ask you why, why oh why
We must understand the ultimate plan
Is that we live a happy life
In the by and by

There's no better feelin'
Than when I rise up to see the morning sun
And watch the sunrise in you eyes
You're like the summer breeze
That comes to me in the winter time
So honey, I hope you realize

You're doing really well my dear

Now every one of us was made to suffer
Every one of us was made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
I can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
Keep on walking on broken glass

ML126,Gino Vannelli,Living Inside Myself,"In my life
I've felt so self assured
But suddenly it's all changed
She's a cloud
That hangs above my world
And I find myself wandering in the rain
And now I can't go on

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I need her guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone

And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But oh how the seasons change
And now I'm not that strong

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this hell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost"

You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

Well, I fight authority, authority always wins
Well, I've been doing it since I was a young kid
And I come out grinnin'
Well, I fight authority, authority always wins

I call up my preacher
I say, ""Give me strength for round 5.""
He said, ""You don't need no strength, you need to grow up son.""
I said, ""Growin' up leads to growin' old and then to dyin'
Ooo, and dyin' to me don't sound like all that much fun.""

A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...

If I gave you pretty enough words
Could you paint a picture of us that works?
An emphasis on function rather than design
Aren't you tired? Cause I will carry you on a broken back
And blown out knees
I have been where you are for a while

[Chorus]
Aren't you tired of being weak?
Such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky
And destroy the prettiest starry night, every evening that I die

[Bridge]
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold
I am exhumed; just a little less human

[Verse 2]
After all these images of pain have cut right through you
I will kiss every scar, and weep you are not alone
Then I'll show you that place in my chest where my heart still tries to beat, it sets us apart

Such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky

There's a lightning storm each and every night
Crashing inside you like motorbikes
We toss and turn, sleep so loud
Grind the teeth in our empty mouths
Our empty...

There's a forest fire burning bright
Spreading quickly towards our last rites
Nowhere to run, pointless to hide
Just lay there and scream, pretending to try
Pretending...

[Chorus]
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and you burn

[Verse 2]
This impending doom is left deep inside
And it's haunting you each and every night
Like starving wolves counting sheep
We close our eyes, pretending to sleep
Descending...

[Chorus]
Intending to burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn, you live and

[Bridge]
Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home

As we burn, pretending to fight it
Everyone learns faster on fire
Things took a turn, lost all desire
You live and you burn
You live and...

Like hell, we are anxiously waiting
Like hell, burning silently strong
Somehow we fell down by the wayside
And somehow this hell is home
Right now, this hell is my home"

Wash me in the river
Give me to the pain of LifeWar

Twenty years gone
And Father told me life was like war
Hands to the bone
Twenty-five years of war
Thirty, I wake
To the sound of souls at war
I will pass through
Buried with the flag of my war

Wash me in the river

Went to the corner of second and main
And there was someone there who mentioned that they hoped
That it would rain forever, forever
So they could drown in peace

(Well I) Went down to the hodskin p.l
But there was nobody to answer when I rang
The doorbell forever, forever
So now I'm sad all the time

Sometimes I'd like to stand on my own two feet

Today was the day
But she threw it all away
And I could never understand
Cause she was never one to play by the rules of the game
Her and me we're so the same

(And I) I try so hard and I never give in
And I am never satisfied until the day that I win against them
But I don't care
I'll follow her to anywhere

Don't stop cause you might get dropped)

You were going to bed
But I'm not done with the night
So I stayed up and read
But your words in my head
Got me mixed up so I turned out the light

My mind's racing from chasing pirates

While the silliest things

Up impossible schemes

ML191,Sade,Never As Good As The First Time,"[Intro]
Never as good
No, baby

[Verse 1]
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you
So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

[Chorus]
It's never as good as the first time
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

[Verse 2]
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
It's like the weather
One day chicken, next day feathers
The rose we remember
The thorns we forget
We'd love and leave
We never spend a minute on regret
It is a possibility, the more we know the less we see
Second time, is not quite what it seems
Natural as the way we came to be
The second time, won't live up to the dream

[Chorus]
It's never as good as the first time (Never as good)
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
It's natural as the way we came to be
The second time is not quite what it seems

It's never, ooh, as good as the first time
As the first time
Never as good as the first time

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream

I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone

I'd gladly risk it all

I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I know you're afraid of what you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help if you'll only let me try
You touched me and something in me knew
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready to kiss that dream goodbye
When it's this sweet, there's no saying no
I need you so, I'm ready to go

If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
[Verse 2: Sting]
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I had to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

[Bridge: Sting]
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say It
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

[Verse 3: Sting]
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die

I hate to say it, but it's probably me

I see them bloom for me and for you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands sayin', ""How do you do""
They're really sayin', ""I love you""

I hear babies cry I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world"

Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home

Each one a line or two
""I'm fine, baby, how are you?""
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough

And you deserve more than that
Another aeroplane, another sunny place

I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
That this was not your dream

There is no escape
And that is for sure
This is the end we won't take any more
Say goodbye

With the feeling to kill
And it will not go away
Until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing
On our minds
Don't try running away
`cause you're the one we will find"
ML220,Red,Death Of Me,"[Verse 1]
I should've seen all the signs all around me
But I was comfortable inside these wounds
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all bow down to you

[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me

[Verse 2]
How can you help my affliction
If you're the sickness and not the cure
Too long I've faked this addiction
Another sacrifice to make us pure

[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all and still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me

[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up (Oooh, ooooh)
You take it all but still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me (Oooh, ooooh)
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me

[Bridge]
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget this
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget this
I won't forget, I cannot forget this
I won't forget, I'll never forget

I know I can never prove this illusion
You aren't the one that I thought you were
So I learn to embrace this delusion
The line that separates us starts to blur

[Chorus]
You tear me down and then you pick me up
You take it all but still it's not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding and you will be the death of me

[Outro]
(Oooh, ooooh)
And you will be the death of me
I won't forget, I cannot forget this! (Oooh, ooooh)
And you will be the death of me

Cut that little child
Inside of me and such a part of you
Ooh, the years burn

What's a boy supposed to do?

It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
I know you hate me, but I'll ask anyway

It goes a one, two, three
Yeah, and it's just another bombtrack

[Verse 1]
And suckers be thinkin' that they can fake this
But I'ma drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down, hand out some beatdowns
Could run a train on punk fools that think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead, I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
To recall the downfall and the businesses that burnt us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough, I call the bluff, fuck Manifest Destiny
Landlords and power whores, on my people, they took turns
Dispute the suits, I ignite and then watch 'em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline

And now dope hooks make punks take another look

Maybe it was on the movie screen
Maybe it was on a television, or on the cover of a magazine
I know and I don't care
Let me see your underware
Let me see how thick you is, baby, let me see what's under there

ML234,Mary J. Blige,Real Love,"[Produced by Mark Morales & Mark C. Rooney]

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I'll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I've tried my best and prayed to God he'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love

[Bridge]
See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

[Chorus]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love"

They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by, they can see me gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
I'm ridin' with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up!""
Next to the PlayStation controller
It's a full clip in my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma (Woo!)
Girl, you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm grippin' oak (Oak)
Music loud and I'm tippin' slow (Slow)
Twin's steady twistin' like, ""Hit this though!""
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
The windows down, got to stop pollution
CD change, niggas like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I still ain't losin'

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
I've been drinkin' and smokin'
Holy shit, cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po-po's scope this
Big old Excurs' just swervin', all up in the curb and
Nigga be sippin' on the Hennessy and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doin' a hundred while I puff on a blunt and roll another one up
We livin' like we ain't givin' a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40-ounce in my lap freezin' my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep, me and my dawgs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wonderin' 'bout the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me, on the lowkey
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, and get it poppin', dawg
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now would you think it's so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Keep steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags (Tags)
Pull me over, try to check my slab (Slab)
The glove compartment, gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein' the baller that I am, I talk to them
Givin' a damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Jammin' number two on some old DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me, I'm 'bout to pull up at your home
And it's on

[Chorus: Chamillionaire]
They see me rollin', they hatin'
Patrollin' and tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
My music's so loud, I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gon' catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me ridin' dirty, tryna catch me ridin' dirty

I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark, let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 'til early in the morn'
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth, baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

Que sea mi nombre el que llene tu cuaderno
De cada olvido quiero ser yo tu razón

Me encantaría ser tu alegría
Ser tu mayor motivación de cada día
El que en tu cama beba tus ganas
Como él que bebe solo en fines de semana

Me encantaría estar de planta en tu vida
Ser tu eterno seductor sin despedida

Me encantaría ya no tener que aguantarme mis deseos
Cuando he sufriendo solo porque no te veo
Me encantaría fueras mía de una vez

Me encantaría ya no tener que esconderme para verte
Por ser tu amante desde ahora y para siempre
Sería capaz de lo que fuera, ya lo ves

Vamos a darnos la oportunidad

ML245,Los Cadetes De Linares,Las Tres Tumbas,"Salieron de madrugada, se oía el canto de los gallos
Iban hacer dos jornadas al lomo de sus caballos
La fiesta se celebraba en el Rancho del Pitayo

Su padre les dio un consejo, cuando a partir se aprestaban
""Cuiden muy bien el pellejo, porque la vida se acaba""
En las palabras del viejo, los tres hermanos pensaban

Pedro le dice a Fabián, ""Dale un trago a José Luis
Que beba de ese mezcal pa' que se sienta feliz
Que ahorita nomás al llegar nos vamos a divertir""

Cuando arribaron al baile, a bailar se dirigieron
La muerte andaba en el aire, ellos no la presintieron
Como les dijo su padre, cuando del rancho salieron

Eran muchos los rivales, viejos rencores surgieron
Rondando tras los jacales abrieron todos el fuego
Así matan los cobardes cuando los acosa el miedo

Un viejito solitario, sin esperanza ninguna
Cuida el rancho y tres caballos como toda su fortuna
Va al panteón de vez en cuando a visitar las tres tumbas"

Y al despertar la nueva luz nos guiará, al mar azul

Esperando a sota de oros te aparece un caballero
Dispense, mi buen amigo, es que yo llegué primero

[Interludio]
Y no se agüite pariente Quitío
Que mejorcitas las hemos deseado
Hay que aguantar la vara señor
Y arriba la Laguna Seca

[Verso 2]
El que no lo quiera creer que le entre a lo pantera
Pierde dinero y mujer y hasta a la portamoneda'
A veces llega a su casa con la camisa de fuera
Y ni modo de reclamos porque yo llegué a caballo
Estoy regando el rosal pa' cortar la flor de mayo
Perdóneme, rey de copas, pero yo soy de a caballo

[Estribillo]
Y sí juegas sin malicia porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros te aparece un caballero
Dispense, mi buen amigo, es que yo llegué primero"

I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbecue
Yea I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouthed bass have got me hooked on Sunday afternoons

Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud Honky Tonk that rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck but I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most

Man I love how Redman tastes
Damn I love my Nascar race
Any song sung by George Strait is country at it's best

Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud Honky Tonk that rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck but I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most

Yeah I love scuffed up cowboy boots
And broken torn up jeans
My 4-wheel drive, 8 point bucks
And rocky road ice cream
And hell yes I love my dog
And Jack D in my Coke
But honey I love your love
Yeah I love your love

I love your love the most

ML257,Steven Curtis Chapman,All About Love,"We've got CD sets and videos, radio and TV shows
Conferences, retreats and seminars
We've got books and magazines to read on everything from A to Z
And a web to surf from anywhere we are
But I hope with all this information buzzing through our brains
That we will not let our hearts forget the most important thing

Is love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
Everything else comes down to this
Nothing any higher on the list than love
It's all about love

Now they're fighting in the middle east
And they're fighting down on Seventh Street
And there are fights in my own house on given days
It's like something's lurking deep inside
That can't seem to be satisfied
But life was not meant to be lived this way
'Cause it's true for every man and woman
Every boy and girl
That our only hope for living here together in this world

Is love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love
Everything else comes down to this
Nothing any higher on the list than love

This is the reason we were made
To know the love of our Creator
And to give the love He's given us away
Yeah, the Maker, and the Father, and the God of everything
He says to love, love, love
He says love, love, love
Love, love, love
'Cause after all, it's all about love

Gods says love, love, love, love, love, yea yea
It's all about love, love, love, love, love (love love love)
Everything else comes down to this
Nothing any higher on the list than love
'Cause after all, it's all about love

All about love, love, love, love, love

Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Bang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Post-Chorus: MNDR]
No way, no, the clock is ticking forward
No way, it's just a cruel, cruel world

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Cruel world is fittin', they got us all hidden
With late night divisions and lab rat incisions
But faced with decisions to fight or fricasse
And you clearly decided on how to handle me
Difficile, imbecile, is it fake? Is it real?
Are we dyin' on our feet? Are we tryin' in our sleep?
There's a rumor goin' 'round 'bout the suits runnin' town
If you look into the sky, dead birds fly high, high, high

[Verse 4: MNDR]
Numbers, you fly by numbers
You're logging hours and don't see the big picture
Over your shoulder, you'll get no last words
Because it's too late, you've clipped your own wings
(Your own wings)

[Chorus: MNDR]
No way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Bang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Bridge: Q-Tip & MNDR]
We're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)
We're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)
We're never gonna believe in the stories that you're weavin'
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)
We're believin' in the proof, we're believin' in the truth
We're believin' in each other, not you, you, you

[Verse 5: MNDR & Q-Tip]
Stories (You with the tall tales)
How many stories? (So many tall tales)
We climb the structure (We scale the ladder)
You build it higher (You make us madder)
We take our aim (So now we're bearin' arms)
You perch above your nest (Gotcha in your charms)
The stories in your head (Crazy bald-headed)
That's what got you dead

[Chorus: MNDR]
No way, bang, you're dead, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
Bang, you're dead, alouette, paint your silhouette
Je te plumerai la tête
Je te plumerai la tête (Oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Outro: MNDR]
Un, deux, trois
No one ever does it like that anymore
Bang, bang, bang
When feathers fly, you can deny everything (Alouette)
Un, deux, trois (Bang, bang)
No one ever does it like that anymore
Bang, bang, bang (Alouette)
When feathers fly, you can deny everything, yeah

ML262,Sting,I Hung My Head,"[Verse 1]
Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 2]
I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 3]
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head

[Verse 4]
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead
I hung my head, I hung my head"
ML263,Carrie Rodriguez,Big Love,"I need love as big as an ocean
I need a love that can't be crossed

Open up your eyes and take a look around
Do you know where this love can be found?

'Cause I'm a full-grown woman
And I'm lookin' for a big love

I need love, gonna move this mountain
I need a love that I can't hide away
I need a love, gonna lift me up to that drinkin' fountain
Just like my daddy did in my younger days

Is this love gonna get up off the ground?
Is this love gonna get up off the ground?
I need a fifty-foot man to wrap these arms around
Is this love gonna get up off the ground?

'Cause I'm a full-grown woman
And I'm lookin' for a big love

Never did just a little drinkin'
I could drink the Milky Way
Think small and your heart starts shrinking
I'm here to stay

I got to have your big love
I've got to have it right away
Mmm, right away

I need a love as big as an ocean
I need a love that can't be crossed

It makes no difference
What I'll do without you

Oh, I love you, my darling
But I'll try and let you be
Goodbye, it's the last
You'll hear of me

Well, I found a bluebird
High on a mountain side
And the little bird
Would sing its little song

So I'll sigh, I'll cry
I'd even wanna die
For the one I love is gone

Well, I found a bluebird

ML265,Shelby Lynne,Family Tree,"I'm not happy with this conversation*
Too little righteous indignation
I'm not sure if I'm mad or mean
The tears I cry could mean anything

Just cause you're kin I let it slide
Insults and judgments I've been blind
And it hard for you to deal out digs
With a calloused heart your words are quick

I'm sick and tired of throwing stones
Cause all that leaves is broken bones
And I won't shed no blood for you
Aww the cuts too deep the bruise too blue

I've wasted time and been hand fed
You can't take back the things you said
Too much time has gone and passed
Shattered lives and broken glass

The pain is felt behind my eyes
But you won't see me through my disguise
Can't change fate cause this is done
Aww too late to start the race is run

Now's the time to face the facts
This train done slid right off the tracks
Regret is sad revenge is sweet
I'm walking on my own two feet

You could have come along but you broke my heart
Now's the time for me to start
Living my life without you
Being a rock in my shoe

Can't write the book cause this one's wrote
Time's a friend and love's a foe
The future's mine indeed it's grand
You ain't a part of my plan

When you lay down and think of me
There won't be much serenity
Just know that the aching in your brain
Is the sound of your soul's grief and pain

This apple's done fall off the Family Tree
This apple's done fall off the Family Tree"

Oh and I won't waste any more time

[Verse 2]
I don't know myself
Oh, but I know you
How can you be so callous?

Oh, don't ever say that we stopped being fair
Or that you don't rely on me when no one else is there
Anymore

Oh, why can't we both talk?
I must have taught myself
That it's a lie on both sides of you

[Chorus]
Oh and I won't waste any more of your time
Oh and I won't waste any more time
Oh and I won't waste any more of your time
And no I won't waste any more time

Give me pain
And pain's outlet, too
When you're miserable
Living eyes
Can't float
To the bottom of the dark
When you're miserable

And no I won't waste any more time
I won't waste anymore of your time
And no I won't waste any more time

ML268,Sidewalk Prophets,You Can Have Me,"If I saw You on the street
And You said come and follow me
But I had to give up everything
All I once held dear and all of my dreams

Would I love You enough to let go
Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me

If You’re all You claim to be
Then I’m not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering

I will love You enough to let go
Lord, I give you my life
I give you my life

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me

I want to be where You are
I’m running into Your arms
And I will never look back
So Jesus, here is my heart

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
My Father, my love
You can have me"

I believe love will find a way
I believe that love is the answer

We sell drugs to children now, well why can't we just see
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it ok

Above Him theres no other

ML281,DecembeRadio,Love Can,"What can move a mountain from the place where it stands?
What can calm the greatest fear with a touch from its hand?
What can turn an enemy to a brother and a friend?
There?s only one thing I know oh, love can, love can

What can bring a miracle in a moment of need?
What can reach a fallen soul and put him back on his feet?
What can say that nothing is beyond its hands?
There?s only one thing I know, yes I know

That only love can heal your broken heart
When it?s all said and done and you've had enough
And only love can bring you off of your knees
And back on your feet, love is all you need, yeah oh
Love can, yeah

What can build a bridge between a holy God and a sinful man?
I know there's only one thing, only love can
And what can help a lost soul find his way back home again
There?s only one thing I know, yes I know, yes I know

That only love can heal your broken heart
When it?s all said and done and you've had enough
And only love can bring you off of your knees
I know love can

Ooh, only love can heal the broken
Love can, only love can
Love can, love can
Love can, only love can, come on everybody

Only love can move a mountain
Only love can, only love can
Only love can heal the broken
Only love can

Only love can move a mountain
Only love can, only love can
Only love can heal the broken
With a touch from it?s hand

Only love can move a mountain
Only love can, only love can
Only love can heal the broken
Ooh, only love can heal the broken
Only love can move a mountain"

ML284,Nichole Nordeman,Time After Time ,"Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new

Flashback to warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said

Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering If I'm OK

Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost
You can look
And you will find me
Time after time

If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time"

No te asombres si te digo lo que fuiste
Un ingrato con mi pobre corazón
Porque el fuego de tus lindos ojos negros
Alumbraron el camino de otro amor
Y pensar que te adoraba tiernamente
Que a tu lado como nunca me sentí
Y por esas cosas raras de la vida
Sin el beso de tu boca, yo me vi
Amor de mis amores, amor mío, qué me hiciste
Que no puedo conformarme sin poderte contemplar
Ya que pagaste mal a mi cariño tan sincero
Lo que consеguirás que no te nombre nunca más
Amor dе mis amores, si dejaste de quererme
No hay cuidado que la gente de eso no se enterará
¿Qué gano con decir que un hombre cambió mi suerte?
Se burlarán de mí, que nadie sepa mi sufrir
No te asombres si te digo lo que fuiste
Un ingrato con mi pobre corazón
Porque el fuego de tus lindos ojos negros
Alumbraron el camino de otro amor
Y pensar que te adoraba tiernamente

No busca un amor
Cuando se enfrenta
A la soledad?

Quién
No sueña despierto
Y cierra sus ojos
A la realidad?

Quién
Es del todo feliz
Y no pasó alguna noche
Sin dormir
Por algún amor
O alguna ilusión?

Quién
No estrecha una mano
Cuando le ofrecen
Algo más que amistad?

Quién
No ha escrito jamás
Una carta de amor
Que no se atreve a mandar?

Quién
No importa la edad
No tuvo un romance
En un rincón de un portal
Y amó bajo el manto
De la oscuridad?

Tarde o temprano
Algún sueño se cumple
Y pasan los días
Sin que el cielo se nuble

Tarde o temprano
Hay alguna razón
Para abrir el corazón

Quién
Si es suyo el error
No llama a quien ama
Y le pide perdón?

Y a quién
No le faltó el valor
Y colgó el teléfono
Al oír su voz?

Quién
Nunca lloró
Por algo, por alguien
Que no pudo alcanzar
Quién no es capaz
De perdonar?

En la noche incesante de la humanidad
Busco ya entre la oscuridad
Esa luz que me de libertad
Mi llanto se deja escuchar
Hoy es mi primer despertar

Todo es tan grande y pequeo
Descubro que hay sueos descubro miradas
Que enfran mi piel
Veo del mundo lo bello y lo cruel
Hay palabras que rompen mi hiel
Pero donde existe el dolor
Siempre hay una semilla de amor

Amor en silencio
Es vivir un momento a tiempo
Amor en silencio
Es un beso amar o dar perdn sin explicar
Solo un alma desnuda esa dicha puede lograr

Amor en silencio
Es andar a favor del viento
Amor en silencio
Es de Dios la manera de ensearnos la verdad
Es ganar en la vida el amor con voluntad

Y aprend a callar porque creo que es mejor
Pero hablan mis ojos en nombre del amor
Hay palabras que muerden y hieren sin razn
Pues lo mas grande y puro lo dice el corazón"

Hay nadie sabe la tristeza que sentía
Porque justo en ese día se casaba mi querer

Ella llego acompañada del padrino
La llevaba a su destino que nunca imagino
Por un momento tuve toda la ilusión
De que en aquel anillo yo le daba el corazón

A la salida de la iglesia engalanada
Ella estaba ya casada la mujer que yo adore
Entre vivas de parientes y de amigos
Me acerque para desearle fuese siempre muy feliz

Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí

Pero resulta que ella no se imaginaba
Encontrarme cara a cara y no supo que decir
Se fue llorando sin pensar que con su llanto
Su vestido iba mojando al llorar sólo por mí"

Pero que mala y aun que de veras te quiero
Comprendo que donde no hay perdón
Tampoco hay amor sinceró

Y tú lo sabes, conoces tanto de mí
Has dicho lo que me duele en el alma
Y eso era, que me mentías
Y te lo digo, sin más orgullo
No te perdí por que nunca te tuve

Comprendo que donde no hay perdón
Tampoco hay amor sinceró"

Siempre de alguna forma me salia con la mia
Hoy soy perdedor estoy llorando y llorar yo no sabia
Nunca había perdido en el amor
Nunca había rodado tan abajo con mi orgullo
Hoy soy perdedor estoy llorando y ese milagrito es tuyo

Duele mucho duele tanto
Duele ser el perdedor pero lo que
Más me duele es vivir sin tu amor
Duele mucho duele el alma
Duele tanto el corazón y con
Mi dolor y todo te agradesco la lección

Nunca había perdido en el amor
Siempre había cortado de esta vida las maduras
Hoy soy perdedor estoy llorando mi dolor mis amarguras

Duele es vivir sin tu amor
Duele mucho duele el alma duele tanto el corazón

Yo no me lo esperaba
Pero te amo cada día mas

Pero de que manera
Me estuve preguntando
Yo que ni lo pensaba
Ni me lo presentí

No puedo estar sin verte

Ya no vivo sin ti

ML303,Joan Sebastian,Sentimental,"[Letra de ""Sentimental""]

[Verso 1]
No, no es que extrañe tanto el sol de tu mirada
Ni es que me falte el tierno roce de tu piel
Sencillamente es que me canso de hacer nada
Y entonces tiendo a recordar, a recordar cosas de ayer

[Pre-Coro]
Más no se piense que vivir sin ti no puedo
Hoy mi nostalgia tiene otra explicación
Sencillamente es que me amaneció nublado
Y el cielo gris
Y el cielo gris siempre me pone el corazón

[Coro]
Sentimental, sentimental

[Verso 2]
No, no es que extrañe el dulce de tus besos
Y hasta disfruto la amargura que hay en mí
En el asfalto no florecen los cerezos
Hoy no hubo sol, hoy no hubo sol
Por eso es que estoy así

[Pre-Coro]
Y no se piense que vivir sin ti no puedo
Hoy mi nostalgia tiene otra explicación
Sencillamente es que me amaneció nublado
Y el cielo gris
Y el cielo gris siempre me pone el corazón

ML304,Palomo,Baraja De Oro,"Voy a jugarme un Amor
Con una baraja de oro
Pues si la gano ya estuvo
Y si la pierdo nimodo
Porque yo soy de los hombres
Que cuando pierdo no lloro

Las mujeres son barajas
Y hay que saber barajear
Pa saber cual es la tuya
Si es la que vas a apostar
No ya despues de perdido
Quieras volver a jugar

Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros
Se aparece un caballero
Dispense mi buen amigo
Esque yo llegué primero

Y ni modo del reclamo
Porque yo llegé a caballo
Y estoy regando el rosal
Pa cortar la flor de mayo
Perdoneme rey de copas
Pero yo soy de a caballo

Y el que no lo quiera creer
Que le entre a lo pantera
Pierde dinero y mujer
Y hasta la portamonedas
Y a veces llega a su casa
Con la camisa de fuera

Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros
Aparece un caballero
Dispense mi buen amigo
Esque yo llegué primero"

There must be another way
When she's gone to a better place
And loneliness will hurt you
If you can't get through the night

If every moment starts to fade
And dawn is just an hour away
I feel she's watching over
And it gets me through the night

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)

I'm thinking back to what we'd share
In many ways I'm already there
And I watch you do it

Don't turn the lights on
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark (x4)

Another lonesome evening spent without you there
And only those who hurt you
Will say patience is a virtue and it's been so long

And I can't think about it
No, I can't figure it out
Cause just how real you're feeling
Every time that you're appearing leaves no room for doubt

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)
I'm thinking back to what we'd share
In many ways I'm already there
And I watch you do it

ML318,Ministry,Everyday Is Halloween,"[Verse 1]
Well, I live with snakes and lizards
And other things that go bump in the night
'Cause to me every day is Halloween
I've given up hiding and started to fight

[Break]
I've started to fight

[Verse 2]
Well, any time, any place, anywhere that I go
All the people seem to stop and stare
They say, ""Why are you dressed like it's Halloween?
You look so absurd, you look so obscene""

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

[Verse 3]
Well, I let their teeny minds think
That they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
And I dress this way just to keep them at bay
'Cause Halloween is every day

[Break]
It's every day

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me?
I'm not the one that's so absurd
Why hide it? Why fight it?
Hurt feelings, best to stop feeling hurt
Denials, reprisals
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world

[Outro]
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide, oh
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide..."

You came waltzing over to me
And Your eyes they saw right through me
And You heard each one of my cries for help
And You came to rescue me

Every prayer that I had spoken
Reached Your ears and all my tears
Weren't cried in vain

You watch over me when the night seems long
You help me to see the way before me

Interceding for Your children
Though I've wandered astray from Your infinite ways
You've never left me alone

And I've watched the lightning, your glory proclaim
I've gazed upon mountains that testify of Your fame
And I've heard the waves on the ocean echo their refrain

This is my song, my song to the King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much, but I give everything
This is my song, song to my King

It seems all creation, oh it's longing for You
From here to the farthest star they're worshipping You
And who am I God that You are mindful of me
I'm simple in heart, simple in song, I'm a small offering

But this is my song, my song to the King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much but I give everything
(Don't have much)
For this is my song, my song to the King

It's all the creation hesitates now
(Hesitates now)
And all of the angels stops singing now
(Stops singing now)
As the King of all glory listens to my song

This is my song, my song to my King
And I stand in awe of Your majesty
And I don't have much but I give everything
For this is my song, song to my King

Is my song to my King

Quickly I was lost along the way
Till You stepped out in front of me
You took my hands and said come on and follow me
This is love

That You shine on
The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near
Whoa
Whoa

You and me we used to be
Lovers torn and lost along the way
Until Heaven came and rescued me
I found grace right in front of me
This is love

That You shine on
The darkness all around us
It all just disappears
You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

We'll never be the same
Cuz You never look away
We'll never be the same
Cuz You never look away

That You shine on
The darkness all around
Yeah You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

The darkness all around us

And You shine on
The walls that crash around us
Whenever You are near

You never look away
You never look away"

At our savior, God and king

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem

To make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought just stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Leave me, leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you

Lately I have desperately pondered
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not reach a solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, and I pray, and I beg

Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me

And lie here with me
Wake up, wake up dreaming

Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

To take a chance on life again
So let me go

The unread book and painful look
The TV's on, the sound is down
One long pause, then you begin
Oh, look what the cat's brought in

[Pre-Chorus]
If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

[Chorus 2]
Wants to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go, let me leave

[Bridge]
For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now
And I don't know what to say to you, but I'll smile anyhow
And all the time I'm thinking, thinking

[Chorus 1]
I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

[Chorus 2]
I want to be a hunter again
I want to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go, let me leave
Let me go"

ML342,Evanescence,My Immortal,"[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

[Verse 2]
You used to captivate me by your resonating light
And now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

And these wounds won't seem to heal
And this pain is just too real
And there's just too much that time cannot erase

In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings

But she was so much like a child
A devil when she held me close
An angel when she smiled
She always held it deep inside
But somehow I always knew
She'd go away when the grass turned green
And the sky turned baby blue

[Chorus]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Verse 2]
She brought colors to my life
That my eyes had never touched
And when she taught me how to care
I never cared so much
I try not to think of her
But I fall asleep and do
And drift off where the grass is green
And the sky is baby blue

[Chorus]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Chorus]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight

[Outro]
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies
Baby blue was the color of her eyes
Baby blue like the Colorado skies

ML360,Porter Wagoner,"Green, Green Grass Of Home","The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areached smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Then I awake and look around me at these four grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
And again I'll touch the green green grass of home
They'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home"
ML361,John Anderson,Wild And Blue,"[Verse 1]
Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home, why do you keep calling?
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's just making you wild and blue

[Chorus]
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Verse 2]
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your minds all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue

[Chorus]
Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up yonder, honey
You're already wild and blue

[Verse 3]
It's four in the morning and you're all alone
With no place to go, why don't you come home?
I'll be right here baby, waiting for you
I know you've been wild and blue

Wild and blue, it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do

ML362,Merle Haggard,Rainbow Stew,"[Verse 1]
There's a big brown cloud in the city
And the countryside's a sin
And the price of life is too high to give up
Got to come down again
When the world wide war is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
When they find out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun come shining through

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

[Chorus]
Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew

[Verse 2]
You don't have to get high to be happy
Just think about what's in store
When people start doing what they oughta to be doing
They won't be booing no more
When a president goes through the white house doors
And does what he says he'll do

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 2x]"
ML363,Juice Newton,Angel Of The Morning,"[Intro]

I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away from me

[Verse 2]
Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echoes say we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

[Chorus]
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby

Then slowly turn away, I won't beg you to stay with me

Of the day
Of the years

Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same

If I didn't have you, I'd long ago
Been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town

Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

[Post-Chorus]
But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

[Verse 3]
Well, I count my blessings every night I pray
That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day He does, 'cause God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

If I didn't have you, I'd long ago
Been left in the dark out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town

Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been

Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'til their judgment day comes, yeah

Que aquel que algún día te pidió por favor te marcharas
Hoy daría hasta el alma
Por que tu regresaras

Es de humanos el equivocarse y pedir perdón
(aunque a veces duele más aceptarlo)
Pero creo que yo he cometido mi peor error
Ni juntando todas las tristezas de mi corazón...
Había llorado así
Había sufrido así
Siento que moriré sin ti

Nunca jamás había llorado así
Y estoy sufriendo como nunca antes sufrí
Y estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre desde el día en que
Te vi partir

Nunca jamás sentí tanto dolor
Es un puñal clavado aquí en mi corazón
Que me desgarra lentamente y me consume
Porque no tengo tu amor

Es de humanos el equivocarse y pedir perdón

Pero creo que yo he cometido mi peor error
Ni juntando todas las tristezas de mi corazón...
Había llorado así
Había sufrido así
Siento que moriré sin ti

Y estoy sufriendo como nunca antes sufrí
Y estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre desde el ía en que
Te vi partir

Nunca jamás sentí tanto dolor
Es un puñal clavado aquí en mi corazón
Que me desgarra y me consume poco a poco
Porque no tengo tu amor

Siento que me estoy muriendo
Por la falta de tus besos
Nunca había llorado así...

Estoy pagando gota a gota cada lágrima de sangre desde el día en que te vi partir
Y ya no aguanto esta pena y así no puedo vivir

Y así no se puede vivir

If you were in my heart I'd surely not break you
If you were beside me and my love would take you
I'd keep you in safety forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you
I'll hide you

Take my hand
Show you feel
Look in my eyes
It's perfectly clear
I love you and cover you
Ask me to tell you what I wanna do
I'll hide you
Away from danger, danger, danger
(Hide you, hide you, hide you...)

If you were in my heart I'd surely not break you
If you were beside me and my love would take you
I'd keep you in safety forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you
I'll hide you

If you were in my heart I'd surely not break you
If you were beside me and my love would take you
I'd keep you in safety forever protect you
I'll hide you away from the world you rejected
I'll hide you
I'll hide you"
ML400,Ronnie Milsap,Stranger In My House,"[Verse 1]
There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

[Verse 2]
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's alright
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know?
Or somebody she just met?
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

[Verse 3]
Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination?
Or has her love turned into lies?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
A stranger in my house"
ML401,Hank Williams,Your Cheatin' Heart,"[Verse 1]
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

[Chorus]
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

[Verse 2]
Your cheatin' heart will pine someday
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

[Chorus]
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

ML402,Mark Chesnutt,Your Love Is A Miracle,"[Verse 1]
Out on the highway, a lot of pretty girls go by
But none have been right
Up until today, I would never settle down
But you keep coming around

[Chorus]
And your love is a miracle, it's spiritual
Got here just in time
Your love is a miracle, it's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine

[Verse 2]
Out in the wildlife, a lot of people telling lies
Lookin' right in your eyes
And up until tonight, I was always on the prowl
But now I'm settlin' down

[Chorus]
‘Cause your love is a miracle, it's spiritual
Stands the test of time
Your love is a miracle, it's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine

Anyone can see what you're doing to me
And everyone can see that you're everything I need

[Chorus]
‘Cause your love is a miracle, it's spiritual
Got here just in time
Your love is a miracle, it's visible
Even to a heart that's blind like mine"
ML403,Dolly Parton,Real Love,"They say that it's a matter of trusting
Before love has a chance to begi-in
And it's never simple
Faithless hearts can cripple
And only a strong love survi-ives
I know they say that it's such a fine line
Between giving up and givi-ing in
Ahh, but once your heart's been in it
You just can't forget it
It's like nothing that you've felt in your li-i-ife
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
Real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destina-ation
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
We...
You are such a part of my life
That I can't remember me without you-ou
And we've had our nights, we've had our share of fights
But we never thought of givin' it u-u-up
Woh, you and I we must be dreamers
'Cause we're makin' all our dreams come true-ue
I could spend my life just holding you so tight
And never ever ge-et enou-ou-ough
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
We got real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destina-ation
Baby, you and me, we got everything we need
We got real lo-ove
We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
Real love, not an imitation
Real love, you're my destina-ation

We got real love, not infatuation
Real love, our heart's celebra-ation
I love you, You know I love you too
We got real love, not an imitation (fade)"
ML404,Patty Loveless,I'm That Kind Of Girl,"There's a man in a Stetson hat, howlin' like an alley cat
Outside my window tonight
Sayin', ""Baby, put on something hot, meet me in the parking lot
About a quarter to nine""

I get the feelin' that he's never read Romeo and Juliet
I'm gettin' tired of these one night stands
But if you wanna make a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

Let me tell you that I like my lovin' just as much as any woman
But I'm drawin' the line
A little sensitivity always seems to get to me every time
I'm a sucker for a love-sick fool
The kind that carries all your books in school
I'm getting tired of these one night stands
But if you're lookin' for a real romance

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl
I ain't the woman in red, I ain't the girl next door
But if somewhere in the middle's what you're lookin' for
I'm that kind of girl, I'm that kind of girl

I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa
I'm that kind of girl, oh whoa"
ML405,The Marshall Tucker Band,Heard It In A Love Song,"[Verse 1]
I ain't never been with a woman long enough for my boots to get old
We've been together so long now they both need re-soled
If I ever settle down you'd be my kind
And it's a good time for me to head on down the line

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

[Verse 2]
I'm the kind of man who likes to get away
Like to start dreaming 'bout tomorrow today
Never said that I love you even though it's so
Where's that duffel bag of mine, it's time to go

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

[Flute, Piano, and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna be leavin' at the break of dawn
Wish you could come but I don't need no woman taggin' along
Goin' sneak out that door, couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw a teardrop in your eye

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

[Verse 4]
I never had a damn thing but what I had, I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder and I guess I always will

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong"
ML406,T. Graham Brown,I Tell It Like It Used To Be,"[Verse 1]
They say that I'm the kind of man who always speaks his mind
To me there's nothing stronger than the truth
You can ask me almost anything and I'll tell it like it is
But darling when they ask me about you

[Chorus]
I tell it like it used to be when you were still in love with me
Before you got too used to me and wanted someone new
I tell it like it ought to be cause how it is, is killing me
When they ask about you and me, I tell it like it used to be

[Verse 2]
I wish that I was stronger
I could tell them that you're gone
But that's one thing that I may never do
If they want to hear about our love
And how it all went wrong
Then darling they'll just have to talk to you

[Chorus]
I tell it like it used to be when you were still in love with me
Before you got too used to me and wanted someone new
I tell it like it ought to be cause how it is, is killing me
When they ask about you and me, I tell it like it used to be

[Chorus]
I tell it like it used to be when you were still in love with me
Before you got too used to me and wanted someone new
I tell it like it ought to be cause how it is, is killing me
When they ask about you and me, I tell it like it used to be"
ML407,Marty Stuart,Burn Me Down,"Touch me, turn me on and burn me down

Your lips hold a wild desire
And give a kiss like the devil's fire
Your kind of love could burn a town
Oh, touch me, turn me on and burn me down

Your touch brings me to my knees
You've got me begging please, please, please
Take my heart and melt it down
Touch me, turn me on and burn me down

You're a wild love I can't tame
Your kisses burn like flames
I go crazy when you're around
So touch me, turn me on and burn me down

I'm devoured by your fiery flame
My lips can only speak your name
Just spread my ashes all around
Oh, touch me, turn me on and burn me down

You're a wild love I can't tame
Your kisses burn like flames
I go crazy when you're around
So touch me, turn me on and burn me down
Touch me, turn me on and burn me down"
ML408,George Strait,Let's Fall To Pieces Together,"[Verse 1]
Pardon me, you left your tears on the jukebox and I'm afraid they got mixed up with mine
I don't mean to pry, it's just that I noticed you going out of your mind
Looks like we're two of a kind

[Chorus]
Let's fall to pieces together, why should we both fall apart?
Let's fall to pieces together, right here in each other's arms

[Verse 2]
Alone is much better together and the worst is still yet to come
So let's share the rest of the tears that are left from two hearts that just came undone
Why should we go crazy alone?

[Chorus]
Let's fall to pieces together, why should we both fall apart?
Let's fall to pieces together, right here in each other's arms

[Outro]
Let's fall to pieces together, right here in each other's arms"
ML409,Sammi Smith,Help Me Make It Through The Night,"[Verse]
Take the ribbon from my hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
'Till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

[Chorus]
I don't care what's right or wrong
I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
But tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night

[Chorus]
I don't care what's right or wrong
I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
But tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Help me make it through the night"
ML410,Dolly Parton,Love Is Like A Butterfly,"[Chorus]
Love is like a butterfly, as soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside, it flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing

[Verse 1]
I feel it when you're with me, it happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle, your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies

The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside, it flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing

And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share, how very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies

I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

[Chorus]
And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bittersweet memories

I will always love you"
ML412,Emmylou Harris,Queen Of The Silver Dollar,"[Verse 1]
She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine o'clock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar's home again

[Chorus]
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules a smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home

[Verse 2]
Now her royal dress is satin
It's shabby and it's torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones
The shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads she's been down
And the places that she's seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen

[Chorus]
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules a smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home

[Verse 3]
Now the queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But there's a man who found her
And he brought her to this world
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl

[Chorus]
Yes I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule a smokey kingdom
My scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around my trying to win my favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home

Yes I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule a smokey kingdom
My scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around my trying to win my favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home"
ML413,Earl Thomas Conley,I Can't Win For Losin' You,"Hey, how've you been? Good to see you again
Gee, it's been a long time
How's that new man, Mom and Dad
Since I told you goodbye?
Now I'm still the same, still raisin' Cain
Nobody's worried 'bout me
I come and& I go, just as I please
Since I set myself free

But I can't win for losin' you
I just can't get over you
Bein' footloose and fancy free
Ain't all it's cracked up to be
And the grass ain't no greener
Here on the other side
I might win a heart or two
But I can't win for losin' you

Well I'm on my way, there's so much to say
Lord knows that I've had my time
Girl, you can bet I'll never forget
When you used to be mine

But I can't win for losin' you
I just can't get over you

Here on the other side
I might win a heart or two
But I can't win for losin' you"
ML414,Charley Pride,Kiss An Angel Good Mornin',"[Verse 1]
Whenever I chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder, ""How does a man get to be this way?""
I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And every time they ask me why
I just smile and say

[Chorus]
""You've got to
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home""

Well, people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
But some of them never learn, it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speakin' of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song
That I always sing

[Chorus]
You've got to
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home

And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like the devil when you get back home"
ML415,The Judds,Love Can Build A Bridge,"[Verse 1]
I'd gladly walk across the desert with no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you in your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin', let me show you what love means

[Chorus]
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would give my heart's desire, so that you might see
The first step is to realize that it all begins with you and me

It ain't none of my concern
I don't really care if you think I'm a lier
I know it's just because your getting burned

Cause I'm watchin' your mustang burn

And I know what your thinkin' man your heart is sinking

True, in this modern world when two lovers get together

Girl, this ain't just another run of the mill emotion
What I'm feeling is the definition of devotion

So there's no way to know when I'll live my last tomorrow

ML418,Vince Gill,When I Call Your Name,"[Verse 1]
I rushed home from work like I always do
I spent my whole day just thinking of you
When I walked through the front door, my whole life was changed
'Cause nobody answered when I called your name

A note on the table that told me goodbye
It said you'd grown weary of living a lie
Oh, your love has ended but mine still remains

And I could tell you once were lovers
But you ain't hiding nothing that I don't know

There's an old flame burning in your eyes
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise
Now that old flame might not be stronger
But it's been burning longer
Than any spark I might have started in your eyes

You said it ended when he left you
You say your love for me is strong
But those old memories still upset you
Well, I might be a memory before too long

Oh little bird why can't I be like you?
Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna be that brave
And never save
My loving for some other rainy day

[Verse 1]
'Cause you fly away
When it's cold and you can't find another way
But you will sing and you will love until you find a place
That you can stay
You can stay
Sing your little heart out 'til your dying day
Oh little bird

[Verse 2]
And I'll fly away
When it's cold and I can't find another way
But I will sing and I will love until I find a place
That I can stay
I can stay
And be as bold as you until my dying day

[Chorus]
Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna sing like you
The whole day through
Oh little bird why can't I be like you?
Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna be that brave
And never save
My loving for some other rainy day

[Outro]
Oh little bird
Oh little bird now I will ne'er be blue
Because of you
Oh little bird now I can sing love true"

You said you'd give to me soon as you were free?
Will it ever be?

You told me that you didn't love him
And you were gonna say goodbye
But if you really didn't mean it
Why did you have to lie?

You said was mine all mine, 'til the end of time?
Was it just a lie?

One fine day in Hell
The master told a story
Someone lied so well
He sent him back to glory

There are whispers between the screams
That this deed can be done

I know I'll be the one to make the Devil cry

ML436,The Who,Long Live Rock,"[Verse 1]
Down at the Astoria the scene was changing
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating
We were the first band to vomit in the bar
And find the distance to the stage too far
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock
Rock is dead they say
Long live rock

[Chorus]
Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive

[Verse 2]
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Landslide, rocks are falling
Falling down around our very heads
We tried but you were yawning
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead

[Verse 3]
The place is really jumping to the Hiwatt amps
Until a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock
Rock is dead, they say
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock

[Outro]
Long live rock, I need it every night
Long live rock, come on and join the line
Long live rock, be it dead or alive"

""Calm yourself"", he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, ""Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps""
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

[Bridge]
As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
No, woah, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Now I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving, no, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)"

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight on a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower that is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

ML461,Julio Iglesias,My Love,"My love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true is ever letting all their love come through

My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too

Let my love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over

Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know enough to say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free

Let our love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over

Say words of love to all we see
To rich or poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spead love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea
Our love's all people"

To never ever hurt no one

And I'm still father's son

I lay awake til daylight
A pillow and a gun
And if my secret dreams could be seen on screen
Then they'll be coming for this one

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Please lord now forgive me
Even though I don't deserve
I never was too good in life
The devil's all I serve
My woman she done left me
I told twice to go
The first time she ignored me
But then I threw her on the floor

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Well I sleep with one eye open
I weep with both eyes closed
Darkness coming down on me and
Tomorrow never knows

Ever I suffer
Ever suffer my fill
And if you don't pray for me now
Nobody ever will

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

Now I'm in the graveyard
It's darkness all around
Voices floating through the air speaking with no sound
You were your father's son
But you left him far beyond
Beyond the reach of mercy
In the darkness of the sun

So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord
So down low better slow down lord

So down low better slow down lord

ML469,Los Tigres Del Norte,Jose Perez Leon,"Él era un hombre de campo, oriundo de Nuevo León
Tenía apenas diecinueve años, su nombre...
José Pérez León

Tenía un primo lejano que de mojado se fue
Al poco tiempo le envió un telegrama diciendo: ""Ven pronto, José""
Pues un trabajo le habían encontrando piscando algodón como él

Y se fue, y se fue ahogando en llanto en el adiós con su mujer
Se fue, sin saber que de ese viaje ya jamás iba a volver
Pobre José

Cuando llegó a la frontera con Willy se entrevistó
Era el pollero más afamado y astuto de la región
Le dijo: ""Pepe, hoy estás de suerte, mañana te cruzo yo""

La madrugada de un viernes, en una vieja estación
Veinte inocentes pagaban su cuota, entre ellos José Pérez León
Y sin dudarlo a todos metieron en el interior de un vagón

El tren cruzó al otro lado casi siete horas después
Fue cuando el aire empezó a terminarse y ya nada pudieron hacer
Nadie escuchó aquellos gritos de auxilio y la puerta no quiso ceder
Uno por uno se fueron cayendo y así, falleció el buen José

Y se fue, y se fue a cruzar el cielo con sus ansias de crecer
Se fue, sin saber que ya su esposa un hijo suyo iba a tener
Pobre José

Así termina la historia, no queda más qué contar
De otro paisano que arriesga la vida y que muere como ilegal
De aquel José que mil sueños tenía y que a casa... Jamás volverá"

ML480,Pete Droge & The Sinners,Beautiful Girl,"I woke up near Rittenhouse Square
There was noise in the hall; snow was flowing in the air
And I could see just then the flashing spark
Of the match to my first smoke

Some houses are built to last
It's the couple inside that change too fast
I can see their faces looking through the glass
They're not where they belong

I want to stay with you, baby
Won't you let me stay?
You're a Beautiful Girl
I'm right where I belong, baby
I'm here with you
You're a Beautiful Girl

I see your feet at the edge of the bed
While an old Love song is creeping into your head
And as your eyes just closed I could only guess
If you were dreaming of me again

Stained glass casts a flickering light
With the curtains closed I can't tell if it's night
But I know for sure that this sure feels right
With you here between my arms

I want to stay with you, baby
Won't you let me stay?
You're a Beautiful Girl
I'm right where I belong, baby
I'm here with you
You're a Beautiful Girl

And I hope that you can take me
When I'm going out of my head
And I hope that you will keep me
Keep me warm in your bed

I want to stay with you, baby
Won't you let me stay?
You're a Beautiful Girl
I'm right where I belong, baby
I'm here with you
You're a Beautiful Girl"
ML481,Roxy Music,Jealous Guy,"I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control

I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

I was feeling insecure
You might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside

I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy

I was trying to catch your eye
I thought that you was trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
I was swallowing my pain

I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy"
ML482,Shawn Colvin,Get Out Of This House,"[Verse 1]
Go jump in the lake, go ride up the hill
Get out of this house
It's a house of your making, it's a house of ill will
Get out of this house

[Verse 2]
Go listen to Buddha, go listen to Joe
Get out of this house
If anyone asks, you tell them you don't know
Get out of this house

[Pre-Chorus]
I spent eleven long years in a hothouse zone
I spent twenty-nine more trying to get home
Well, I never got home, but I did what I did
And I got myself this house, and you can't come in, oh

[Chorus]
Get out of this house
Get out of this house

[Verse 3]
I'm the queen of my castle, I'm the king of my room
Get out, get out of this house
I got more than I need, more than I ever could use
Get out, get out of this house

[Pre-Chorus]
I spent seventeen years tryna to save my soul
I spent twenty-three more down in the hole
Now my soul is all right, but I might get found out
And I got myself this house now, and I can't get ou-out

[Chorus]
Get out of this house
Get out of this house

[Bridge]
If I see you again, it will be in my head at the end of a cloud
If you see me again, it will be in your head telling you to get out

[Verse 4]
You act like a baby, you talk like a fool
Get out of this house
Go back to your mama, go back to high school
Get out of this house

[Verse 5]
Go jump in the lake, go jump out the door
Get out, get out of this house
I've had all I can stand, and I can't stand no more
Get out, get out of this house
Get out of this house"
ML483,U2,Window In The Skies,"The shackles are undone
The bullets quit the gun
The heat that's in the sun
Will keep us when there's none
The rule has been disproved
The stone it has been moved
The grave is now a groove
All debts are removed
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's doing to me?
Love makes strange enemies
Makes love where love may please
The soul and its striptease
Hate brought to its knees
The sky over our head
We can reach it from our bed
You let me in your heart
And out of my head, head

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's doing to me?

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Please don't ever let me out of you

I've got no shame, oh no, oh no

Oh can't you see what love has done?
Oh can't you see?
Oh can't you see what love has done?
What it's doing to me?
I know I hurt you and I made you cry
Did everything but murder you and I
But love left a window in the skies
And to love I rhapsodize
To every broken heart
For every heart that cries
Love left a window in the skies
And to love I rhapsodize"
ML484,Mark Schultz,Love Has Come,"Well, I know this life is filled with sorrow
And there are days when the pain just lasts and lasts
But I know there will come a day
When all our tears are washed away with a break in the clouds
His glory coming down and in that moment

Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, everyone will see
That God is love and love has come for us all

For anybody who has ever lost a loved one
And you feel like you had to let go too soon
I know it hurts to say goodbye
But don't you know it's just a matter of time 'til the tears are gonna end
You'll see him once again and in that moment

Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, everyone will see
That God is love and love has come for us all

Oh, and on that day we will stand amazed
At our savior, God and king
Just to see the face of amazing grace
As our hearts rise up and sing

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Thank You for the cross
Singing glory, glory, hallelujah
Christ has paid the cost

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Thank You for the cross
Singing glory, glory, hallelujah
Christ has paid the cost

And every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
That God is love and love has come for us all
Every heart set free, every one will see
That God is love and love has come for us all

Love has come for us all
Love has come for us all

And every knee shall bow, every tongue confess
God is love, love has come for us all
Every heart set free, everyone will see

ML485,Sidewalk Prophets,You Can Have Me,"If I saw You on the street
And You said come and follow me
But I had to give up everything
All I once held dear and all of my dreams

Would I love You enough to let go
Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me

If You’re all You claim to be
Then I’m not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering

I will love You enough to let go
Lord, I give you my life
I give you my life

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me

I want to be where You are
I’m running into Your arms
And I will never look back
So Jesus, here is my heart

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me

When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
My Father, my love
You can have me"
ML486,Josh Wilson,Before The Morning,"[Verse 1]
Do you wonder why you have to
Feel the things that hurt you?
If there's a God who loves you
Where is He now?
Or maybe there are things you can't see
And all those things are happening
To bring a better ending
Someday, somehow you'll see, you'll see

[Chorus]
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still have a reason to sing?
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming
So hold on, you gotta wait for the light
Press on and just fight the good fight
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the dark before the morning

[Verse 2]
My friend, you know how this all ends
And you know where you're going
You just don't know how you'll get there
So say a prayer
And hold on
'Cause there's good for those who love God
But life is not a snapshot
It might take a little time, but you'll see the bigger picture

[Chorus]
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still have a reason to sing?
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming
So hold on, you gotta wait for the light
Press on and just fight the good fight
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the dark before the morning

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, before the morning
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Once you feel the weight of glory
All your pain will fade to memory
Once you feel the weight of glory
All your pain will fade to memory
Memory, memory, yeah
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still got a reason to sing?
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming

[Chorus]
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still got a reason to sing?
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming
Come on, you gotta wait for the light
Press on and just fight the good fight
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the hurt before the healing
Oh, the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the dark before the morning

Before the morning, yeah, yeah
Before the morning"
ML487,Brandon Heath,Your Love,"[Verse 1]
I felt it first when I was younger
A strange connection to the light
I tried to satisfy the hunger
I never got it right
I never got it right
So I climbed a mountain and l built an altar
Looked out as far as I could see
And every day I'm getting older
I'm runnin' outta dreams
I'm runnin' outta dreams

[Chorus]
But your love, your love
The only the thing that matters is your love
Your love is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

[Verse 2]
You know the effort I have given
And you know exactly what it cost
And though my innocence was taken
Not everything is lost
Not everything is lost (No)

[Chorus]
But your love, your love
The only the thing that matters is your love
Your love is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

[Bridge]
You're the hope in the morning
You're the light when the night is falling
You're the song when my heart is singing
It's your love
You're the eyes to the blind man
You're the feet to the lame man walking
You're the sound of the people singing
It's your love, your love

[Bridge]
Love, your love I needed
Love, your love I lean on
Never ever seen such love before, you (Your Love)
Love, your love I needed
Love, your love I lean on
Never ever seen such love before, you

Your love (Your love)
The only the thing that matters is your love (Your love)
Your love (Your love) is all I have to give (Oh)
Your love (Your love) is enough (Enough) to light up the darkness
It's your love (Your love)
Your love (Your love)
All I ever needed is your love

Your love is all that I needed
All I ever needed is your love (Your love)

ML488,Jeremy Camp,Take You Back,"The reason why I stand
The answer lies in You
You hung to make me strong though my praise was few
When I fall I bring Your name down
But I have found in You a heart that bleeds forgiveness
Replacing all these thoughts of painful memories
But I know that Your response will always be

I'll take You back always, yeah
Even when your fight is over now
Even when your fight is over now
I'll take you back always, yeah
Even when the pain is coming through
Even when the pain is coming through
I'll take you back

You satisfy this cry of what I'm looking for
And I'll take all I can and lay it down before
The throne of endless grace now that radiates what's true
I'm in the only place that erases all these faults that have overtaken me but I know That your response will always be

I'll take you back always, yeah
Even when your fight is over now
Even when your fight is over now
I'll take you back always, yeah
Even when the pain is coming through
Even when the pain is coming through
I'll take you back

I can only speak with a grateful heart as I'm pierced by this gift of Your love
I will always bring an offering I can never thank You enough

You take me back always, yeah, even when my fight is over now
Even when my fight is over now
You take me back always, yeah, even When my pain is coming through
Even when my pain is coming through

And secure until your phone call
You were telling me goodbye

I'm looking for another pure love in my life

Now the wheel of fate has turned
I'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered
He is a problem in my life
I have a problem on my mind
Things you cherish most in your life
Can be taken if they're left neglected
Leaving a problem in your life

I'm looking for another pure love in my life

ML497,Cassandra Wilson,Time After Time,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
And I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, and I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after

My picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after time
Mmm..."
ML498,Patrice Rushen,Remind Me,"[Verse 1]
I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
I'm under your spell each time that you appear
A kiss so passionate that has me mesmerized

It sets my heart aglow
And I want you to know

ML500,Chayanne,Tu Boca,"Boca
Tejidos atrevidos como un libro de aventuras
Que ha puesto ante mi boca tanta locura

Tu boca loca, penetra por mi boca
Y llega a ser más que mi vida
Que ha dejado mi boca tan derretida
Ay, qué boca que me sofoca

Yo no puedo pasarme un día sin ver tu boca
Sin que algo conspire en mi contra
Y me hable de tu boca, de tu boca
He intentado ganarle al tiempo una batalla
Pero tu boca prepara una emboscada
Y se me encarna en la mirada
Tan carnosa, tan sobrada

Esa boca
(esa boca) esa boca me tiene hasta el cuello
Esa boca me dice mi cielo
Me hace bailar, me hace la boca un mar
Esa boca tan boca, esa loca

(Esa boca) esa boca me induce en su magia
(esa boca) esa boca me baña en su savia
Y no hay en mi boca otra boca
Tan boca, tan loca, tan ella, tan toda, no hay

Yo no puedo pasarme un día sin ver tu boca
Sin que algo conspire en mi contra
Y me hable de tu boca, de tu boca
He intentado ganarle al tiempo una batalla
Pero tu boca prepara una emboscada
Y se me encarna en la mirada
Tan carnosa, tan sobrada

Esa boca
Esa boca me tiene hasta el cuello
Esa boca me dice mi cielo
Me hace bailar, me hace la boca un mar
Esa boca tan boca, esa loca

ML501,Jeremias,Hay Un Amor Afuera,"Con un llanto empieza el baile
De la vida sin que alguien
Te explique como es

En un mundo al revez
Donde lo unico seguro
Siempre es un tal vez

Anda sin avanzar
Guardando de a poquito
El tiempo en el ayer

Remando río arriba
Cada noche, cada día
Sabiendo que

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir

Caminando en la corniza
Entre la rabia y la risa
Se va la juventud

Detrás de un cielo azul
Que se quedo en fotografías
Dentro de un baúl

Un barco en baja mar
Volver de la oficina
A punto de llorar

Pero la luna llena
Que una noche desempeña
En recordar

Que hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir

Cada cual tiene un boleto
Que nos lleva
Lejos de la soledad

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
La sangre se acelera
Lo que queda es salir

Hay un amor afuera
Que espera por ti
No tardes tanto nena
Que voy a morir"
ML502,David Bisbal,Esclavo De Sus Besos,"No me preguntes por qué
A veces la nombro por casualidad
Y es que aún la recuerdo
Y es que aún llevo dentro su forma de amar

Una razón para ti
Me pides motivos y una explicación
Para no desterrarla ahora y para siempre de mi corazón

Yo soy así y seguiré vagando errante por tu piel
Yo no podré dar todo de mí mientras no olvide a esa mujer

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión
En el que esta obsesión está apartándome de ti
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Y sigo sin saber por qué razón sigue ella en mi interior
Y en nuestro punto de inflexión
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos

No hay quien controle el amor
De hecho te quiero como a nadie a más
Pero a veces es ella la que me derrumba mi seguridad

Yo soy así y seguiré vagando errante por tu piel
Yo no podré dar todo de mí mientras no olvide a esa mujer

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión
En el que esta obsesión está apartándome de ti

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Y sigo sin saber por qué razón sigue ella en mi interior
Y en nuestro punto de inflexión
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos

Yo no podré dar todo de mí mientras no olvide a esa mujer

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Hemos llegado a un punto de inflexión
En el que esta obsesión está apartándome de ti
Y sigo esclavo de sus besos y sigo preso de mis miedos
Y sigo sin saber porqué razón sigue ella en mi interior
Y en nuestro punto de inflexión

Y sigo esclavo de sus besos"

To God alone be the glory
To God alone be the praise
Everything I say and do

Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man

[Verse 3]
I guess you know I'm faking
When I tell you I love you
I guess you know that I am blind
To everything you say and do
Must be something on my mind
There's nothing left for me to hide
Do you know I'm faking?

Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it once before on him
Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man

We have to succumb to
The feelings we can never face
I need you, I breathe you
I can't go through this all again

We have to succumb to
The feelings we can never face
I need you, I breathe you
I can't go through this

Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it once before

Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it once before on him
Then she told me she had a gun
It sounded like she'd used it once before, oh man

She says she wants to use it on me now"

Standing with my enemy
Hung on my horns
With haste and reverie
Killing with charm

Only happy when you hurt
Only deadly in a swarm
Only healthy in the dirt
Only empty in your arm

I play, I'm sick and tame
Drawing the hordes
I wait and show the lame
The meaning of harm
The skull beneath my feet
Like feathers in sand
I graze among the graves
A feeling of peace

Only bending when you break
Only feeding when you're cold
Only healing when you ache
Only feeling when you don't

ML524,Alex Bueno,Que Vuelva,"Anda ve a decirle que yo estoy sufriendo
Dile que no puedo con las penas
Tú que te das cuenta que la quiero
Ve a decirle que mi alma se quema

Tú que eres su amiga y sabes de mis sueños
Cuéntale que el mundo se me acaba
Vamos date cuenta que me muero
Que sin ella no soy nada

Ve y dile que mi vida sólo es vida si ella está
Que no soporto más esta terrible soledad
Que me la encuentro siempre en cada sueño
Que ya no duermo
Que si miro al espejo su reflejo encuentro allí
Que pronuncio su nombre y nada quiero decir
Que allí está su risa en mis recuerdos
Que ya estoy casi enloqueciendo

Dile que aquí está el hombre que la ama
Que siempre ha sido el dueño de su vida
Que siempre hay una lágrima en mi cara
Que ya no puedo más con las heridas
Háblale, dile que yo he sentido engañarla
Que se acaba mi vida
Que se muere mi alma, dile...

Que vuelva, a decir que aún me puede amar
Pero que vuelva a mí
Que sin ella no puedo vivir

Anda ve a decirle que no hay un segundo
Que no me hagan falta sus caricias
Que me hacen daño los minutos
Que deliro por su sonrisa

Anda ve a decirle que más primaveras
No veré llegar si no regresa
Que si las miradas no me llegan
Sé que pierdo la cabeza

Dile que no hay un instante donde no piense en su piel
Que me muero de angustia porque yo no la puedo ver
Y pierdo mil intentos en buscarla
Y no me habla
Que aunque rompí su foto aún su imagen sigue ahí
Clavada en mi memoria y no se puede salir
Que está en cada rincón de nuestra casa
Que su recuerdo casi me mata

Dile que aquí está el hombre que la ama
Que siempre ha sido el dueño de su vida
Que siempre hay una lágrima en mi cara
Que ya no puedo más con las heridas
Háblale, dile que yo he sentido engañarla
Que se acaba mi vida
Que se muere mi alma, dile...

Que vuelva, a decir que aún me puede amar
Pero que vuelva a mi
Que sin ella no puedo vivir

Que vuelva, a decir que aún me puede amar

Dejamos escapar

Muy sola
Si lloras por mi
Yo no tengo la culpa
Fui parte de ti
Y no te olvide nunca
Recuerdas quizas
Aquel beso apurado
Que te deje al partir
Y en ti quedo guardado
Y hoy lloras por mi

Te esperaría otra vez y no lo haré, no lo haré

Qué difícil es pedir perdón
Ni tú ni nadie, nadie puede cambiarme

Vete de aquí, no me supiste entender
Yo sólo pienso en tu bien, no es necesario mentir
Qué fácil es atormentarse después
Pero sobreviviré, sé que podré, sobreviviré

Solo una mentira se viene conmigo a pasear
Sentirme querida en aquel abrazo en el mar

Te di todo el amor que pude darte y me robaste

Hoy tu amor corta como el cristal

Donde los recuerdos no hacen llorar
Vienen muy despacio y se van

Que no eran mis labios los que ahora te hacen soñar

[Verso 1]
Cierro los ojos sin mirar atrás
Las cosas buenas pesan más y más
Y tus errores tienen la virtud de hacerme mal
Hasta he intentado escapar de aquí
Pero me cuesta renunciar a ti
Parece ser que voy del norte al sur una vez más

[Coro]
Algo de ti está acabando conmigo
Algo de mí se está muriendo contigo
Cada minuto se convierte en un siglo
Y cada sitio es un espacio vacío
Algo sin ti es nada y pierde el sentido
Porque sin ti vivir no es más que un castigo
Es como un barco que navega perdido
Yo sólo quiero rescatar, rescatar lo perdido

[Verso 2]
A veces pienso que esto es el final
Que no hay motivos para continuar
Pero yo siento que te quiero aún incluso más
Y si me quieres para qué pensar
Mientras tú piensas, la vida se va
Mañana es tarde para regresar a este lugar

[Coro]
Algo de ti está acabando conmigo
Algo de mí se está muriendo contigo
Cada minuto se convierte en un siglo
Y cada sitio es un espacio vacío
Algo sin ti es nada y pierde el sentido
Porque sin ti vivir no es más que un castigo
Es como un barco que navega perdido
Yo sólo quiero rescatar lo perdido

[Coro]
Algo de ti está acabando conmigo
Algo de mí se está muriendo contigo

You can see that you're being surrounded from every direction
Love was just something you found to add to your collection
It used to seem we were number one, but now it sounds so far away
I had a dream we were running from some blazing arrows yesterday

[Chorus]
You said fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire

[Verse 2]
Now the city blocks out the sun that you know is rising
You can show me the work that you've done, your fears have been disguising
Is it just me or is everyone, hiding out between the lights
Where will we be when we've come undone? Just a simple meeting of the minds

[Chorus]
Singing we'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Through desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire, fire with fire, fire with fire
Your desire, desi- sire, desire, through your desire

Underneath your stars
There's a million lies burning brightly just like fireflies

It's cold and heaven surround you from every direction
Cause there's someone behind every hand that you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on and tomorrow has become today, become today

And now we're free to be number one, the morning isn't far away
We've got a reason to keep holding on, tomorrow has become today

Will come and go
You reach for love
But life won't let ya know
That in the end
You'll still be lovin' her
But then she's gone
You're all alone

Sign of pain
Is on my face, well
My hearbeat stops
But I won't take the blame, no no
I gave her all the love I had within
My love was strong
Somethin' went wrong, no! no!

I never meant for this to happen (Ooh)

Everything I miss at home
You know how to hold me
And do all the things I want to feel
Inside of each tender kiss
I get everything I miss at home

ML542,The Staple Singers,Respect Yourself,"[Verse 1]
If you disrespect anybody
That you run in to
How in the world do you think
Anybody's supposed to respect you?
If you don't give a heck 'bout the man
With the Bible in his hand
Just get out the way
And let the gentleman do his thing

You're the kind of gentleman
That want everything your way
Take the sheet off your face, boy
It's a brand new day

[Chorus]
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na, na, na, na
Respect yourself, respect yourself

[Verse 2]
If you're walking 'round
Thinkin' that the world
Owes you something
'Cause you're here

You're goin' out
The world backwards
Like you did
When you first come here

Keep talkin' 'bout the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand on your mouth
When you cough, that'll help the solution

Oh, you cuss around women folk
And you don't even know their names
And you're dumb enough to think
That'll make you a big ol' man

[Chorus]
Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na, na, na, na
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Respect yourself, respect yourself"

When I first laid my eyes on you
I saw your smile and knew right then and there
You reached out and touched my hand
And two became just one person
No one could have stopped our love affair

I, I guess that with our love that too has flown

Sure enough good to see you, but its time to go
Dont say yes but please dont say no
I dont want to be lonely tonight

Go away then, damn you
Go on and do as you please
You ain't gonna see me gettin down on my knees
Im undecided, and your hearts been divided
Youve been turning my world upside down

Do me wrong, do me right (right now baby)
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight

ML558,Kindred The Family Soul,House Of Love,"Every time I think about where we were and where we are
Something that's unbelievable
We been building on the slow but to see it come together
It's like a dream's achievable

We had bumps along the way, quite a few surprises
But we held fast, dealt with all the compromises
Put our pride aside how we sacrifice so long
For something we could call our own

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

I used to think of all the things we've overcome
As just our history
But now I know that all the things we built together
Will be our legacy

The world will know that we were here
Our intent to stay sincere, our purpose and hearts were clear
Our babies will have babies of their own
And our love will live on for generations to come

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

Every step, solid rock as a foundation
And a roof made of hope for our protection
A room of opportunity driven by affection

And every room I put my heart
And if these walls they could talk
They would keep you up all night
Telling you the first day
We moved to our biggest fight

Make so many memories
So here's and extra set of keys
Love made it whicha share it
Whicha right here in this house

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

Welcome to making this house
People we entertain in this house
Our family in this house, our house [Incomprehensible]
You know, this house"

ML560,Usher,Burn,"[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn (Yeah), let it burn (Ooh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through (Yeah)
Let it burn (Let it burn, woah), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you

Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now, it's too late
I know she ain't comin' back
What I gotta do now (Now) to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours

When your mouth is laying ope
Head knocked back, you don't cope
You're out of rings and flowers and soap
Love comes to me
Love comes to me

Love comes to me
Love comes and all
It's my hands, my heart, my lips
And that is all

When the fever hits on your forehead
And trusive mice chew up your bed
And you call on God and God is dead
Love comes to you
Love comes to you

O, sugar won't you be my only
I'm a hard-hearted honey-pot hungry shepherd
And I'm longing to be born for you, that's her

Love comes to you
Love comes and all
It's your hands, your heart, your lip

And the backs of your knees conceal me
And your eyeballs, they unreal me
Love comes to me

I could dance all night
I could dance all night

Shake your rattle-snake skin
And become a part of society
Wait on down the highway
To see how far I'll come a-run a-run
Run running
All that we had salvaged from the fire
Was a waste of time
(But) what a waste of time

Should I trust all the rust that's on TV
I guess with some distaste I disagree
With quite a fashionable dispassion for
The dispossessed under-stressed
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
And I don't care if you don't like it
Or just don't see

Now that we fattened the cow
And set out to plow unknown enemies
""Wow!"" shouts the startled crowd
""How now did you see what I did see?""
The ravaged cabbage drifts on dark red skies
And it looks so nice
Gee it looks so nice

Shout just let it on out
Confusion becomes a philosophy
Down we're reaching the town where we
Don't have to stand around and look
Over our shoulders
Hell I never knew was what we made it
Let's just take it slow in this home on ice"

Spinning on its axis
Lead white vapor in the clouds
The pavement sucks right through the grates
The pavement sucks right through the ground

Don't go to Yale
Your disposition
Will only make you fail
You got a brain trust
You got a bloodlust

And I don't need this violence anymore
But now i've tasted hatred i want more

To understand the killer
I must become the killer
And I don't need this violence anymore
But now I've tasted hatred I want more

The velvet cell within men
Gloriously rusted masks
Grey death heart crocuses
The velvet cell

And I had always thought
The desire to kill was a disease you caught
But it's dormant in the hearts of everyone
Waiting for a spark, an emotion, an emotion

The velvet cell within men
Gloriously rusted masks
Grey death heart crocuses
The velvet cell within men
Gloriously rusted masks
Grey death heart crocuses
The velvet cell
The velvet cell"
ML575,Jemina Pearl,I Hate People ,"[Verse 1]
Another lonely night
I think if I'm lucky I'll get into a fight
I hate everything I see
It's a different city with the same old scene
A waste of space
Then what a surprise
Through the dull conversations and glazed-over eyes
There you were in all your glory
I could tell that you wouldn't bore me

[Chorus]
Oh I, I hate people
But I, I like you
Oh I, I hate people
And you, you do too!

[Verse 1]
I was walking
Around wanting to die
Thought I wouldn't make it through the night if I try
But I saw you standing there
In your torn leather jacket and dark brown hair
You were different
From all the rest
My eyes saw only yours and that big mess
As I pushed past the people to get to you
I saw in your eyes that you already knew

[Chorus]
Oh I, I hate people
But I, I like you
Oh I, I hate people
And you, you do too!

[Bridge]
I thought that we could get together
I thought that we could have some fun
Just the two of us
Alone together (Yeah, baby)
Hating everyone!

[Chorus]
Oh I, I hate people
But I, I like you
Oh I, I hate people
And you, you do too!

Oh I, I hate people
But I, I like you
Oh I, I hate people
And you, you do too!"
ML576,Asobi Seksu,Thursday,"[Verse 1]
On gentle ground
I waited for you
In drops of dew
I wished they were you
With heavy hands
I reached out for you
My skin soaking wet
My eyes searched for you

[Chorus]
It seems you lost your way
You’ve let it all fall apart
Nothing’s left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we’ve lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me

[Verse 2]
With sharpened tongue
I cried out for you
And must I refrain
Now that I need you
The autumn wind feels
As if it were you
And swayed through the fields
Where I once held you

[Chorus]
It seems you lost your way
You’ve let it all fall apart
Nothing’s left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we’ve lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me

We act the same as you"

They'll take your pride and crush it
The fall that comes is real, by pure degradation
Amputate, Humiliate
Who can take this punishment?
Create something new
A warrior where there once was nothing

Destroy the body and mind
Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind
Today is a good day to die

(Broken mind) – Face down in the sand
(Spirit) Spirit – (Rise) Rise

Destruction comes only once in a lifetime
Cannot be great in your mind
This is the time to say your last prayer
If you desire peace, then prepare for war

Destroy the body and mind
Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind
Today is a good day to die
Destroy the body and mind
Behold the spirit can survive
Destroy the body and mind
I am ready for mine

ML579,Elliott Smith,Let's Get Lost,"I've been outside
Invited in
But I couldn't abide
Went missing again
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost

I had true love
I made it die
I pushed her away
She said please stay
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost
To find some beautiful place to get lost

Well I don't know where I'll go now
And I don't really care who follows me there
But I'll burn every bridge that I cross
And find some beautiful place to get lost
And find some beautiful place to get lost"
ML580,Spank Rock,What It Look Like,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They took me lightly like a quiet boosting of a piece of candy
From your favorite neighborhood corner store
Surely shoulda saw the weight
A heavy burden to carry the bare soiled slate
They don't wanna have a thing to do with
Can't blame them take a look
Can't name 'em cause they shook
Took over some wit-protect
Stay with your kin boy
Fuck around with B'more
Make you look like you're white in a Harlem shaking contest
I harness the fondest crooks of phonics
Fuck grammar, ill-mannered
Don't start with Spank

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Awww ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat, I'm more you're more the less
Oh ease up motherfucker, take a breath
You look beat now, now I suggest you take a rest

[Verse 2]
Can't say what I will or won't do
Stretch the height
You might want to stay on your toes to
Secure a full view
For skewed vision conditions lead you to assume
And while you assume
I'm feeling uneasy
My patterns are broken
Shared my thoughts but my guts don't even believe me
Sleep don't relieve me, it's like doom conceived me
Got a whole lot of something, yet I constantly feel
Like nothing much, just your average such and such
So much acclaimed moving
But nigga I'm really touched

What was I drinking?
(falling under would've boxed that nigga
If you didn't pull me back, spitting on his new shoes)

What was he thinking?
(man I wonder, do I smile too much?
Yes, you too can get fucked up)

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me what it...

I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it and in the end
All these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me what it...

I'm sick with it, I stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it looks like, tell me what it is

(sit the fuck…there ain't no dancing, no dancing)

[Verse 3 x 2]
My tongue is the drum
My mind’s the machine
Non dreamer's far fantastic extremes
Fall victim to this think tank-M16
Sound, sharp, fixed, fit, creased, greased, and clean

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me what it...

I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
Now tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is

Tell me what it look like, tell me what it is
Tell me what it...

I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it

I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it
I'm sick with it, I'll stick with it
And in the end all these niggas gonna get with it"

The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
And I think to myself

The colours of the rainbow
So pretty in the sky

They're really saying I love you

I hear babies cry, they watch them grow
They learn much more, they 'll never know

Yes I think to myself

ML586,Billie Holiday,Nice Work If You Can Get It,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if
Won't you tell me how?"

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

It's gonna be so easy
For us to fall in love

Hey baby, what's your hurry?
Relax and don't you worry
We're gonna fall in love

We're on the road to romance, that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime
'Cause nice and easy does it every time

We're on the road to romance, that's safe to say
But let's make all the stops along the way

The problem now of course is
To simply hold your horses
To rush would be a crime

And foolish though it may seem, to me, that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you

I was a teenage anarchist
Looking for a revolution
I had the style, I had the ambition

There was no war but the class war
I was ready to set the world on fire
I was a teenage anarchist
Looking for a revolution

[Chorus]
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

I was a teenage anarchist
But the politics were too convenient
In the depths of their humanity
All I saw was bloodless ideology
With freedom as the doctrine
Guess who was the new authority?
I was a teenage anarchist
But the politics were too convenient

Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

I was a teenage anarchist
But then the scene got too rigid
It was a mob mentality
They set their rifle sights on me
Narrow visions of autonomy
You wanted me to surrender my identity
I was a teenage anarchist
The revolution was a lie

Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
Do you remember
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
When you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day, we'll walk in the sun

I'm taking tickets
Watching the men always looking down
Sometimes I feel like an animal
In the zoo, staring out

No one looks me in the eye
They save it for the girls inside
I don't much care what they see
I know she saves it all for me

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day, we'll walk in the sun

Some people come here for love
Some come for curiosity
I know there will be a day
I know we'll figure out a way

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun

Someone come, come my someone
Take the clouds from my eyes, my one
I know that sometime soon
One day we'll walk in the sun

One day we'll walk in the sun
One day we'll walk in the sun
One day we'll walk in the sun
One day we'll walk in the sun"
ML599,Brian McKnight,Crazy Love,"[Verse 1]
I can hear her heartbeat
From a thousand miles
Hear the heavens open
Every time she smiles
And when I come to her
That's where I belong
Yet, I'm running to her
Like a river strong

[Chorus]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

[Verse 2]
She's got a fine sense of humor
When I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her
When the sun goes down
Take my troubles away
Take away my grief
Take away my heartache
In the night like a thief

[Chorus]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

[Bridge]
Yes I need, yes I need her in the daytime (I need her)
And oh I need, yes I need her in the night (I need her)
I want to throw my arms all around her (I need her)
To kiss and hug and kiss and hug her tight
And oh

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
And when I'm returning
From so far away
She gives me sweet sweet lovin'
Brighten up my day
It makes me righteous
And it makes me whole
Makes me mellow
Down into my soul

[Chorus Outro]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, crazy love
One more time, she gives love, just a little love
When I wake up in the morning
She gives me love, love, love
Crazy, crazy love"

Es que no soy el mismo de ayer
Un día es un siglo sin ti

Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
'Cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain

ML617,Kenny Loggins,Meet Me Half Way,"In a lifetime
Made of memories
I believe
In destiny

Every moment returns again in time
When I've got the future on my mind
Know that you'll be the only one

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Out where the world belongs
To only you and I

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life

In a lifetime
There is only love
Reaching for the lonely one

We are stronger when we are given love
When we put emotions on the line
Know that we are the timeless ones

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Out where the world belongs
To only you and I

Meet me halfway
Across the sky
Make this a new beginning of another life

Meet me halfway
Across the sky

Is it will last your whole life through
Never will go out of fashion
Always will look good on you

You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love

Long before I met you, darlin'
Lord, I thought I had it all
I could have my lunch in London
And my dinner in St. Paul

I got some friends in Albuquerque
Where the governor calls me ""Gov""
You can give 'em all to Goodwill
For the glory of true love

You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love

Glory, glory, glory, glory
You can't never get enough
Time alone will tell the story
Of the glory of true love

Glory, glory, glory, glory
You can't never get enough
Time alone will tell the story
Of the glory of true love"

ML640,Theory Of A Deadman,Hate My Life,"[Verse 1]
So sick of the hobos
Always begging for change
I don't like how I gotta work
And they just sit around and get paid
I hate all of the people
Who can't drive their cars
Bitch, you better get out of the way
Before I start falling apart
I hate how my wife
Is always up my ass
She always wants to buy brand new things
But I don't have the cash

[Chorus]
I hate my job, all of my rich friends
I hate everyone to the bitter end
Nothing turns out right, there's no end in sight
I hate my life

[Verse 2]
How come I never get laid?
Nice guys always lose
How could she have another headache?
There's always some kind of excuse
I still hate my job, my boss is a dick
I don't get paid nearly enough to put up with all of his shit

[Chorus]
I hate my job, all of my rich friends
I hate everyone to the bitter end
Nothing turns out right, there's no end in sight
I hate my life

[Verse 3]
I hate that I can't tell
When a girl's underage
You know, I tell her she's a nice piece of ass
Then her daddy punches me in the face
So, if you're pissed like me
This is what you gotta do
Put your middle fingers up in the air
Go on, and say, ""Fuck you!""

[Chorus]
I hate my job, all of my rich friends
I hate everyone to the bitter end
Nothing turns out right, there's no end in sight
I hate my life

No, it's nothing new
Hear ""it sucks to be you""
I fuckin' hate my life

Can you feel my trigger-hand moving further down your back
When you hide, hide inside that body
But just remember that when I touch you
The more you shake, the more you give away

Cold but I'm still here, blind 'cause I'm so blind, say never
We're far from comfortable this time
Cold, now we're so cold, mine and you're not mine, say never
We're far from obvious this time

Wait another minute here, time will kill us after all
Now you can feel it's second-hand wrapped around your neck
So fall into my eyes and fall into my lies but don't you forget
The more you turn away, the more I want you to stay

Cold but I'm still here, blind 'cause I'm so blind, say never
We're far from comfortable this time
Cold, now we're so cold, mine and you're not mine, say never
We're far from obvious this time

You're so endearing, you're so beautiful
Well, I don't look like they do
And I don't love like they do
But I don't hate like they do
Am I ever on your mind

Cold but I'm still here, blind 'cause I'm so blind, say never

It does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me

Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in the rat race
And these days, that's a special way of life

(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home

[Verse 2]
In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checker board
Old men tellin' lies and crownin' kings
Kids drivin' 'round the old town square
Cops roll down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shakin' at the Dairy Queen

(Chorus)
Down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home
A man's good word and a handshake are all you need
Folks know
If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on

When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised
Down home

Those of us raised up
Down home

If they're fallin' on hard times, they can fall back on

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated
I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing
But I’m not dead

'Cause tomorrow’s another day
And I’m thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain

No, I’m not gonna let it get me down

In the absence
I will introduce my wrath
My malice
Wicked cancer grows beneath the surface
Head to finger
You make me sick
Hating on my freedom
It doesn't matter
What you say
It eats away...

I am the hunted
I am the atrocity
The only chance my kin survives
I am the hunted
I am the atrocity
The only chance my kin survives

This is a war of attrition
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
This is a war of attrition

No...we are the voice of tomorrow
No...to lies and deception
No...to the chokehold of despair
No...it eats away

This is a war of attrition
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on
This is a war of attrition

In the return from disenchantment
There is but one thing on his mind
How has it come to this?
All that is remembered
Cast into the landscape searching for his...retribution
Retribution...the only chance
Blood will spill
Blood will spill
Bow down to your master
Retribution
Retribution

Bring it on
This is a war of attrition...
Attrition
This is a war of attrition"

Are you ready to take the chance and risk it all?
It's do or die, fight or flight
Do you want to feel alive?
So would you play a game of Russian Roulette
To save your life, are you in, are you in?
Or will you flee to safety, and wonder what could have been?
Don't be afraid, don't ever be afraid
Oh, now you've been hiding, you've been hiding
You've been hiding in the shadows

You're afraid, when you're afraid
Take a chance don't let it weigh you down
You've got to get out of here
You're afraid, when you're afraid
Take a chance don't let it wear you down
You've got to get out

You're trapped in the cave, confined
Falling back to the comfort of your world
Last time you walked away from this
You were looking back to see what you missed

Take a shot with a gun to your head

Keep blowing and we both understand

It's a sign of love
Sign of love
Sign of love

And a little less time
But there still are roses on the vine

This is for those who care
I got my reason
No more in despair
We stand united
This is decided
The hand of fury
You're all invited

I crawl out of this nightmare
Out of the shadows
I walk into the devil's lair
My life
My path
Is where faith grows

'Cause I'm still alive
Feed the ﬁre inside
I'm
I'm still alive
The fuel
The ﬂame
Will ignite

This is the threshold
This is the quickening
No more rampage
In the battle ring
Fight for independence
For what you believe
The right to stand out
The glory to receive

I crawl out of this nightmare
Out of the shadows
I walk into the devil's lair
My life
My path
Is where faith grows

'Cause I'm still alive
Feed the ﬁre inside
I'm
I'm still alive
The fuel

All these years of agony
And bring it
Take now
What I've learned from all these years of agony
And bring it to you

Bring it here tonight"
ML664,The Sword,Freya,"A sword of fire and an axe of cold
Vision of the sibyl has foretold
Armies gather on the battle plain
All will fall and Earth will die in flame

Here on the battle plain
We will die in flame

In falcon's feathers soaring overhead
Choosing warriors among the dead
Twilight written in the runes of crones
Freya weeps upon her golden throne

Upon her golden throne
We wait for her alone
Call us unto your hall
Take us into your thrall
The battle rages, but they fight in vain
When all is done, it must begin again"
ML665,Inoj,Time After Time,"[Verse 1]
I'm lying in my bed
Hear the clock tick
And think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion, there's nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after...
Sometimes you'll picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
And you said, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me (And you will find me)
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secret stolen
All from deep inside
The 808's on time

If you're lost, you can look
And you will find me
Time after time (Time after)
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting (And I will be waiting)

ML666,Reba,Strange,"[Verse 1]
I laid there feeling sorry for myself
In a bed of Kleenex
Stuffing chocolates in my mouth
On the phone with my best friend
Cussing my ex

He broke my heart
Felt like the world had ended
I cried myself to sleep
Thinking I can't get over him

[Chorus]
Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love
Strange

[Verse 2]
Got half a mind
To spend my whole pay check
On one of those dresses
The strapless black ones
That are so famous
For teaching lessons

Drop by his place
Pick up the rest of my things
He'll tell me I look good
I'll laugh and say, yeah I will in time

[Chorus]
Strange, talk about luck
I woke up and the sun was shining
Strange, I ought to be in bed
With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love

With my head in the pillow crying
Over us, but I ain’t, ain’t love

ML667,Tanya Tucker,Some Kind Of Trouble,"Late one night, I heard a knock on my door
To no surprise, it was my landlord
He notified me I was late with the rent
What do you do with your last dollar spent?

You got trouble
Some kind of trouble

I called up my baby for a little advice
'Cause my sugar baby always treats me so nice
I had a funny feelin' he was not alone
When I heard another voice whisper ""hang up the phone""

I got trouble
Some kind of trouble
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
There never any trouble for me to find
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)

I went to my boss
Said, ""I need a little time
To work on this poor old broken heart of mine.""
He said, ""I'd like to help you.  I've been there before
The problem is, girl, you don't work here no more

You got trouble
Some kind of trouble.""
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
There's never any trouble for me to find
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
I got trouble

I was down around low as a body can be
So I talked to my preacher about prayin' for me
He smiled and he said, ""Child, you're not alone
'Cause all God's children got to deal with their own trouble

Some kind of trouble.""
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind
There's never any trouble for me to find
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
Some kind of trouble.  (Some kind of trouble.)
Trouble in my heart, trouble on my mind

I can see you in the arms of another girl instead

Crying you a river that winds and winds and winds

Ain't gonna be no more boohooin'

When your world is just a lie?

From the ashes (from the ashes)
Look inside
Search for meaning
Truth cannot survive

I feel the hate inside you
I watch it burn (burn!)
You heard the warnings
But you, you never learned

This is the price you pay
For throwing your whole life away
Pretend to understand
You never even try!

Still I rise
From the ashes (from the ashes)
Look inside
Search for meaning
Truth cannot survive

Still I rise
From the ashes (from the ashes)
Look inside
Search for meaning
Truth cannot survive
Truth cannot survive!

Watch it burn
The hate inside you
No return
Ignore the warning signs!

Search for meaning
Truth cannot survive

Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive

I'm fettered and abused
Stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one-man submarine?
I only want the truth
So tonight, we drink to youth
I'll never lose what I had as a boy

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart

There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And a world at the window
Gone underground

There's a hole in the sky
Where the sun don't shine
And a clock on the wall
And it counts my time

And Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart

There's a song on the air
With a 'love you' line
And a face in a glass
And it looks like mine

And I'm standing on ice when I say
That I don't hear planes
And I scream at the fools
Wanna jump my train

And Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart
Yeah, Heaven is the whole of our hearts
And Heaven don't tear you apart

Yeah, Heaven

ML680,Crocodiles,Sleep Forever,"Yesterday the sky was cold and grey
Kept me as a prisoner in my home
Ground through my door when I was all alone
Scowled down on me laughed with the Sun
As he hid himself from darkness from everyone

The sky sometimes, so unkind, first he rains and then he shines
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me
And lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la

The sky today was brilliant and blue
Brightened up the walkway to my door
Brought you as a sunbeam on my floor
Beamed you down on me from the other side
Brought you up to me across the ocean wide

The sky sometimes so unkind then again he’s my best friend
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
When he smiles on my face his clouds all seem so out of place
I will love you 'til the sky above you, shatters over you and me
And lays us down to sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Sleep forever, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la"

My heart needs protection
And so do I

It's gonna take a lotta love
To get us through the night
It's gonna take a lotta love
To make things work out right

So if you are out there waiting
I hope you show up soon
You know
I need relating not solitude

Gotta lotta love

Falling to the city in broad daylight

Against your old controlled hate
Pollution of mind filled all the space and destroyed my light
At least mine were never allowed

ML710,Chalino Sanchez,El Crimen De Culiacan,"[Letra de ""El Crimen De Culiacán""]

[Verso]
Les cantaré este corrido a dos hombres que mataron
Sin tenerles compasión vilmente los torturaron
Y ya muertos, con un carro por encima les pasaron
En la colonia El Palmito, la ciudad fue Culiacán
Andaban Francisco López, también Francisco Beltrán
Ellos no se imaginaban que los iban a matar
Francisco López tenía unas cuentas atrasadas
Había matado derecho al que le robó a su amada
Pero Francisco Beltrán no tenía culpa de nada
Otro día los encontraron al amanecer el día
Tenían las tripas de fuera y un perro se las comía
Unos momentos después, llegaba la policía
Con la banda sinaloense los fueron a sepultar
Y dos madresitas lloran sin poderse consolar
Por sus hijos adorados que ahorita en el cielo están
Ya con esta me despido, y les digo en mi cantar
Que las malas compañías nada bueno han de dejar
Lo digo por el corrido, no se les vaya a olvidar"
ML711,Shedaisy,Come Home Soon,"I put away the groceries
And I take my daily bread
I dream of your arms around me
As I tuck the kids in bed

I don't know what you're doin'
And I don't know where you are
But I look up at that great big sky
And I hope you're wishin' on that same
Bright star

I wonder, I pray

(Chorus:)
And I sleep alone
I cry alone
And it's so hard livin' here on my own
So please, come home soon
(Come home soon)

I know that we're together
Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck
Pressed to my heart

I wonder, I pray

(Repeat Chorus)

(Bridge:)
I still imagine your touch
It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance

I wonder, I pray

(Second Chorus:)
I sleep alone
I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home
So please, come home soon

(Third Chorus:)
I walk alone
I try alone
I'll wait for you, don't want to die alone
So please, come home soon

Come home soon
Come home soon"
ML712,Garth Brooks,Standing Outside The Fire,"[Verse 1]
We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned

[Verse 2]
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned

[Pre-Chorus]
But you've got to be tough when consumed by desire
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire

[Verse 3]
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

[Verse 4]
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all

[Pre-Chorus]
They're so hell-bent on giving, walking a wire
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

[Bridge]
There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

[Chorus]
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire"
ML713,Lee Ann Womack,I May Hate Myself In The Morning,"Ain't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is all lonely
Late night calls like this, that we try to find
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate msyelf in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight"

I hurry to my blue heaven

A little nest that nestles where the roses bloom
Just Marley and me, and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven

I'm waiting in tears looking for my baby, and I wonder where can she be?

I saw my baby one morning, and she was walking on down the street
I saw my baby one morning, yeah, she walking on down the street
Made me feel so good until my poor heart would skip a beat

I got a bad feeling my baby, my baby don't love me no more
I got a bad feeling my baby don't love me no more
Now the sky's been crying, the tears rolling down my door"
ML719,Elvis Costello,One Bell Ringing,"[Verse 1]
Rain slapping on a window pane
An hour or two of teeming
Storm punching like a hurricane
That tore him out of dreaming
Air screaming through the slightest gap
Rattling between the frame and the sill
Drapes hanging from the final act
When I had you still

[Chorus]
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood on his lament
Dash him down on the cold cement
One bell ringing

[Verse 2]
Flies buzzing 'round the strip search light
They've got him down on his knees
He dreams of honey dripping from a spoon
Girls whispering in Portuguese
Between the muzzle and the black site
Electrical contact
Deny your name, then carry the blame
Somewhere after the fact

[Chorus]
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood of his lament
Dash him down on the cold cement
One bell ringing"
ML720,Nicki Minaj,Save Me,"[Verse 1]

This time, won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up

It's not your fault, I'm a bitch, I'm a monster

This time, won't you save me?
This time, won't you save me?

ML721,Brandon Heath,Your Love,"[Verse 1]
I felt it first when I was younger
A strange connection to the light
I tried to satisfy the hunger
I never got it right
I never got it right
So I climbed a mountain and l built an altar
Looked out as far as I could see
And every day I'm getting older
I'm runnin' outta dreams
I'm runnin' outta dreams

But your love, your love
The only the thing that matters is your love
Your love is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

You know the effort I have given
And you know exactly what it cost
And though my innocence was taken
Not everything is lost
Not everything is lost (No)

But your love, your love
The only the thing that matters is your love
Your love is all I have to give
Your love is enough to light up the darkness
It's your love, your love
All I ever needed is your love

[Bridge]
You're the hope in the morning
You're the light when the night is falling
You're the song when my heart is singing
It's your love
You're the eyes to the blind man
You're the feet to the lame man walking
You're the sound of the people singing
It's your love, your love

Love, your love I needed
Love, your love I lean on
Never ever seen such love before, you (Your Love)

ML726,Juan Gabriel,Abrazame Muy Fuerte,"[Letra de ""Abrázame Muy Fuerte""]

[Verso 1]
Cuando tú estás conmigo es cuando yo digo
Que valió la pena todo, todo lo que yo he sufrido
No sé si es un sueño aún o es una realidad
Pero cuando estoy contigo es cuando digo:
Que este amor que siento es porque tú lo has merecido
Con decirte amor que otra vez he amanecido
Llorando de felicidad;
A tu lado yo siento que estoy viviendo
Nada es como ayer

[Coro 1]
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y él nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo
Abrázame que el tiempo es oro si tú estas conmigo
Abrázame fuerte, muy fuerte, y más fuerte que nunca
Siempre abrázame

[Verso 2]
Hoy que tú estás conmigo
Yo no sé si está pasando el tiempo o tú lo has detenido
Así quiero estar por siempre
Aprovecho que estás tú conmigo
Te doy gracias por cada momento de mi vivir
Tú cuando mires para el cielo
Por cada estrella que aparezca, amor, es un ""te quiero"" (""Te quiero, te quiero"")
Abrázame que el tiempo hiere y el cielo es testigo
Que el tiempo es cruel y a nadie quiere por eso te digo:

[Coro 2]
Abrázame muy fuerte amor, mantenme así a tu lado
Yo quiero agradecerte amor todo lo que me has dado
Quiero corresponderte de una forma u otra a diario
Amor, yo nunca del dolor he sido partidario
Pero a mí me toco sufrir cuando confié y creí
En alguien que juró que daba su vida por mi
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y ese no se detiene
Abrázame muy fuerte amor que el tiempo en contra viene
Abrázame que Dios perdona, pero el tiempo a ninguno
Abrázame que no le importa saber quien es uno
Abrázame que el tiempo pasa y él nunca perdona
Ha hecho estragos en mi gente como en mi persona
Abrázame que el tiempo es malo y muy cruel amigo (Amigo)
Abrázame muy fuerte amor"

[Verso 1]
Voy a jugarme un albur con una baraja de oro
Que si lo gano ya estuvo y si lo pierdo ni modo
Porque yo soy de los hombres que cuando pierdo no lloro
Las mujeres son barajas y hay que saber barajear
Pa' saber cuál es la tuya, es la que vas apostar
No ya después de perdido quieras volver a jugar

[Estribillo]
Y sí juegas sin malicia porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros te aparece un caballero
Dispense, mi buen amigo, es que yo llegué primero

Y no se agüite pariente Quitío
Que mejorcitas las hemos deseado
Hay que aguantar la vara señor
Y arriba la Laguna Seca

[Verso 2]
El que no lo quiera creer que le entre a lo pantera
Pierde dinero y mujer y hasta a la portamoneda'
A veces llega a su casa con la camisa de fuera
Y ni modo de reclamos porque yo llegué a caballo
Estoy regando el rosal pa' cortar la flor de mayo
Perdóneme, rey de copas, pero yo soy de a caballo

Esperando a sota de oros te aparece un caballero

ML732,Intocable,Contra Viento Y Marea,"Siento un vacio que va
Ahogandome una vez mas
Te quema el aire en la piel
Y vivir me da igual

Me duele tanto saber
Me duele solo pensar
Que moriremos asi y de igual forma te vas
Tus palabras me pueden mentir
Tu mirada jamas

Contra viento y marea
Y tal vez contra el mundo
Luchare con quien sea
Sin dudar un segundo
Con todo el corazon
A matar o morir
Contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti

Llevo un silencio que da
La sensacion de gritar

Tengo la mente en tu voz
Que pide nunca olvidar
Tus palabras me pueden mentir
Tu mirada jamas

Contra viento y marea
Y tal vez contra el mundo
Luchare con quien sea
Sin dudar un segundo
Con todo el corazon
A matar o morir
""CONTRA VIENTO Y MAREA POR ESTAR JUNTO A TI""

CON UN SUEÑO QUE PIDE
CON MI FE QUE TE SIGUE
Y CON TODO EL AMOR

Con todo el corazon
A matar o morir
Contra viento y marea por estar junto a ti
JUNTO A TI"

They say for every boy and girl
There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart

[Chorus]
Young love, first love (You're my love, you're my love)
Filled with true devotion
Young love, our love (You're my love, you're my love)
We share with deep emotion

[Verse 2]
Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Will tell me that your love is real
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another
There will never be another
Love for you or for me

Young love, first love (You're my love, you're my love)
Filled with true devotion
Young love, our love (You're my love, you're my love)
We share with deep emotion"
ML734,Dolly Parton,Yellow Roses,"[Verse 1]
""Hello,"" you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out and to your surprise
And to mine, I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes to a single yellow rose

[Verse 2]
And for years to come, you were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk and share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every rare occasion
And for no good reason too
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you

[Chorus]
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go?
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds?
I still love you so

[Verse 3]
I never see a yellow rose
That I don't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellows turned to blue
The day you left, my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell note
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose

[Chorus]
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go?
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds?
Oh, I still love you so
Yellow roses (Yellow roses)
The color of sunshine (The color of sunshine)
You loved me at one time (You loved me at one time)
Why did you have to go? (But you have to go)
Yellow roses (Sweet yellow roses)
Are you sending your new love (Are you sending your new love)
My bright yellow rose buds? (My bright yellow rose buds)
I still love you so (I still love you)
Yellow roses
The color of sunshine"

Smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last

And I never told you 'til just now!

Perdona si te estoy llamando en este momento
Pero me hacía falta escuchar de nuevo
Aunque sea un instante tu respiración

Disculpa sé que estoy violando nuestro juramento
Sé que estas con alguien, que no es el momento
Pero hay algo urgente que decirte hoy

Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte
Agonizando muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuélveme mis fantasías
Mis ganas de vivir la vida
Devuélveme el aire

Cariño mío, sin ti yo me siento vacía
Las tardes son un laberinto
Y las noches me saben a puro dolor

Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla
Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida
Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol

Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte
Agonizando muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuélveme mis fantasías
Mis ganas de vivir la vida
Devuélveme el aire

Cariño mío, sin ti yo me siento vacía
Las tardes son un laberinto
Y las noches me saben

Vida, devuélveme mis fantasías
Mis ganas de vivir la vida

Y en las sombras
Mueren genios sin saber
De su magia
Concedida, sin pedirlo
Mucho tiempo antes de nacer

Llegue hasta aquí
Y luego prentenda salir
Con el fuego de
El atardecer
Arde la hierba

Y se ve, un jinete
Que se marcha con el viento
Mientras grita
Que no va a volver

Y la tierra aquí
Es de otro color

Saben si lo son
Pero lo quieren creer

No saben llorar

No tiene lugar
Cuando lo triste es vivir

And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin' for

[Bridge]
Well think about me when you're out there honey
You know sometimes that I will
Sometimes I feel like a broken stone rollin' down your hill

And you, you don't even know what it is that you're fightin' for"
ML752,Janie Frickie,It Ain't Easy Bein' Easy,"Surely you can sit down for a while
Maybe you can even smile
And I'll try to pretend that you love me again
But it might take me a little while
I know you'll be holding me tight
You'll know when the moment is right
When I was broken in two it was all because of you
But baby I need you tonight

It ain't easy being easy
Oh no
You're the one who took my heart and my soul
You walk away and left me out of control
It ain't easy being easy
Oh no

(No it ain't)
Easy when you're needing someone
It ain't easy being under the gun
But I'll surrender even though I should run
It ain't easy being easy

It ain't easy being easy
Oooh
It ain't easy being easy

I might end up lonely again
But once you were my only friend
So I'll hold you and cry with the truth in my eyes
Hoping you'll love me again

It ain't easy being easy
Oh no
You're the one who took my heart and my soul
You walk away and left me out of control
It ain't easy being easy
Oh no"
ML753,The Statler Brothers,Bed Of Roses,"[Verse 1]
She was called a scarlet woman by the people
Who would go to church but left me in the streets
With no parents of my own, I never had a home
And an eighteen-year-old boy has got to eat

[Verse 2]
She found me outside one Sunday morning
Begging money from a man I didn't know
She took me in and wiped away my childhood
A woman of the streets this lady Rose

[Chorus]
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

[Verse 3]
She was a handsome woman just thirty-five
Who was spoken to in town by very few
She managed a late evening business
Like most of the town wished they could do

[Verse 4]
And I learned all the things that a man should know
From a woman not approved of, I suppose
But she died knowing that I really loved her
Of life's bramble bush I picked a rose

[Chorus]
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand

[Outro]
This bed of Rose's that I lay on
Where I was taught to be a man
This bed of Rose's where I'm living
Is the only kind of life I'll understand, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
ML754,Dolly Parton,But You Know I Love You,"When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up from another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road once again it seems
All that's left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you

And how I wish that love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have 'cause I've got so much to give
But you know I feel so sad down inside my heart
That the dollar signs should be keeping us apart
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you

And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent, so I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this traveling life, well, it's the only life I know
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you

But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you

But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh how I love you"

2005 Against All Gods Mix:
I don't know love, I never cared to and I'm not sure if I ever will
I'm a student of hate. I know now that god is a medium
Whatever I expected to save me from this life is no longer the one I can hate
It is the people that made me; it is the people I wanted so much to be
I may only find love in their destruction

Talking about Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin

That casket, it looked like a fine Seville
He had a vanity license and a Cadillac grille
Willie was propped up in the driver's seat
He had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet
Fine red suit had the whole town talking
Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Yeah, Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin

In his Cadillac to Heaven he was waving his banner
He left like he lived, in a lively manner
With hundred dollar bills in his fingers tight
He had flowers for wheels and flashing headlights
He been wishing for wings, no way he was walking
Talking about Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Yeah, Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin

You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes

Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (when the night)
Meets the morning (meets the morning) sun?

Is love I can be sure of

I hear a hand stroke on a drum

Elegant boy
Beautiful girl
Dancing for joy
Elegant whirl
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

Two young lovers dance face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway
Then slip away
To some secluded place
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

Whispering trees
Echo their sighs
Passionate pleas
Tender replies

Lovers in flight
Upward they glide
Burst at the height
Slowly subside
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

And my slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it's not a dream
The two are you and me
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

Oh shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night

Tired of this, done with that
Never satisfied with where I'm at

Shot my drugs, drank my booze
Tired of joy and self-abuse
Eternally jaded, through and through
Just a self-loathing dick without a clue

Same old shit, just different day and year
Killed myself, but that got boring too
So beyond the point where it's not true

Far beyond high, dramatically low
Eternal stare, as if I care to know
All of this struggle, all of this work
In the end, you die like some moronic jerk
Shot my drugs, drank my booze
Tired of joy and self-abuse
Eternally jaded, through and through
Just a self-loathing fuck without a clue

Me marcaste con tus huellas

Que me tienes que decir?

Siempre te he de amar, que sin tí mas ya

Una sonrisa, que es cierto no hay amor infiel

I hurry to my blue heaven
Turn to the right, a little white light
Will lead me to my blue heaven

I'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom
Just Jilly and me and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven

A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom
Just Jilly and me and little baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven"

How we disassemble
The parts and frame

I guess we don't know

[Chorus]
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start

If there's anyone near when we collide
We throw them in the middle
They can pick sides

As the plans turn into compromise
The promises all turn to lies
The spite builds up and I can't get through
Passive me, aggressive you
I know I nag, I moan I know
But with a plan like this it's way too slow
In the time it took to get this bad
I could've made this work but all I had
Was the hope that pieces would take shape
And we could watch them all fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place
Fall into place

All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start
All of this is tearing us apart
I don't know where us or this start"

The man in a tracksuit attacks me

If it wasn't for chip fat they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

Met you on a springtime day
You were minding your life and I was minding mine, too
Lady, when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation and, darling, that's when I knew

(Chorus)
That it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

(Verse 2)
Oh, I wake up in the night
And I reach beside me hoping you will be there
But instead I find someone
Who believed in me when I said I'd always care

(Chorus)
Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

(Bridge)
So I lived my life in a dream world
For the rest of my days
Just you and me walking hand in hand
In a wishful memory

Oh, I guess that's all
That it would ever be

(Verse 3)
Wish I had a time machine
I could make myself go back until the day I was born
And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that I'd be yours from now on

(Chorus)
Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along

Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else"

Or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us
Or stop us from holding hands

'Cause I love you

Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart

And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

It would be easier to take the cold from snow
Or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take my love from you, baby
'Cause you're my heart's desire

I really love you
(I love you)
I love you from the bottom of my heart

And what love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together
Can't nobody take it apart

Even if they separate us
A thousand miles apart
We will still be together
In each other's hearts

It would be easier to change
All the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change
The way I feel about you, oh, I love you dear

I really love you
(I love vou)
Oh, baby, I love you from the bottom of my heart

Love has joined together
What love has joined together
What love has joined together

You're trying to do all you can for me
I appreciate your help
But it's best just to leave me be

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Girl I can do without you

Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then I'd be finished for good
So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue

I don't want you to think I'm mean
Refusing all your help
The time has come, but my need is none
And I want to be alone with myself

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me"

No me sonrojo si te digo que te quiero
Si te digo que te quiero"
ML847,Ricardo Arjona,Pinguinos En La Cama,"[Letra de ""Pingüinos en la Cama""]

[Verso 1]
Vamos aclarando este asuntico
Ni tú estás pa' policía
Ni yo para andar huyendo
Vamos aclarando y te repito
Que no tengo todo el día para seguir discutiendo
Si esto fuera una olimpiada
Romperías todos los récords
De arruinarnos el momento

[Verso 2]
Vamos aclarando este pendiente
Yo no soy tu propiedad
Y me harté de hacerme el mudo
Quítate el complejo de teniente
Que el amor sin libertad
Dura lo que un estornudo
Son iguales los defectos que hoy me tiras en la cara
Y al principio eran perfectos

[Coro 1]
Vamos aclarando el panorama
Que hay pingüinos en la cama
Por el hielo que provocas
Si hace más de un mes que no me tocas
Ni te dejas sobornar por este beso escurridizo
Que busca el cielo y encuentra el piso

[Coro 2]
Vamos aclarando el panorama
Yo no estoy pa' crucigramas
Ni tú para masoquista
Ya no sueñas viajes al caribe
Por tu rol de detective y mi papel del fugitivo
Yo busco un sueño y tú un testigo

[Verso 3]
Siempre con la misma cantaleta
Me voy para no volver
Tengo listo el equipaje
Llenas y vacías la maleta
¿Cómo puedes pretender que me coma ese chantaje?
Tienes cero en actuación
Diez en manipulación
Y una beca en el psiquiatra

[Coro 1]
Vamos aclarando el panorama
Que hay pingüinos en la cama
Por el hielo que provocas
Si hace más de un mes que no me tocas
Ni te dejas sobornar por este beso escurridizo
Que busca el cielo y encuentra el piso

[Coro 2]
Vamos aclarando el panorama
Yo no estoy pa' crucigramas
Ni tú para masoquista
Ya no sueñas viajes al caribe
Por tu rol de detective y mi papel del fugitivo
Yo busco un sueño y tú un testigo

[Verso 4]
Con la dosis justa de cinismo
Preguntas qué harías sin mí
Si ya no vuelves a verme
Para ser sincero haría lo mismo
Solo que si estoy sin ti
Lo haría sin esconderme
Lo haría sin esconderme"
ML848,The Oak Ridge Boys,Fancy Free,"I'm setting Fancy free, because she wants to go
She's tired of loving me, she told me so
I guess she don't know just how much she means to me
But along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free

Oh Lord you just don't know how it hurts to say goodbye
She did her best to stay, I can't say she did not try
I just hope the road she takes leads back to me
So along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world
Along with all my dreams I'm setting Fancy free

Yes I'm setting Fancy free, even though I love her still
She'd be no good to me if I held her against her will
Even thou that girl, she's the best part of my world"
ML849,Bobby Bare,500 Miles Away From Home,"[Intro]
I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Verse 1]
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Chorus]
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home

[Verse 2; Lines 1-3: Spoken, Line 4: Sung]
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home but it sure looks different now
Well I guess I look different too 'cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home

[Verse 3]
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

[Chorus]
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm still five hundred miles away from home
Lord I'm still five hundred miles away from home"

Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

[Pre-Chorus]
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
And without your sweet love
What would life be?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me, you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue birds singing a song
Nothing but blue skies from now on

[Verse]
I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly by
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see

Nothing but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on"
ML852,Ronnie Milsap,"Happy, Happy Birthday Baby","Happy, happy, birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you

Happy, happy, birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget

'Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember the names we had for each other
You were my pretty, I was your baby
How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too

Happy, happy birthday baby
Do you remember the names we had for each other
You were my pretty..I was your baby
How could we say goodbye?

Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I know I'm acting kinda crazy
So, I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too

Happy, happy, birthday baby..."
ML853,Dolly Parton,Think About Love,"[Verse 1]
I can't forget you
Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind
And I need to
Somehow let you know
That I think about you all the time

[Chorus]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me

[Verse 2]
We were strangers
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
Oh, what's a heart to do?
Because it lingers
And the thought of you
Wanting me as much as I want you

[Chorus]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me

[Verse 3]
Makes me blue
I'm not holding you
Tonight
Because only you
Can satisfy
This heart of mine

[Chorus]
So when you think about love, think about me
'Cause I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
So when you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
'Cause I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me
'Cause I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me"
ML854,Marty Robbins,Big Iron,"[Verse 1]
To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 3]
In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

[Verse 5]
Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 6]
The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death

[Verse 7]
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

[Outro]
Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip"
ML855,Faron Young,Hello Walls,"(Hello, hello)
Hello walls (hello, hello), how'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her since she upped and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company

Hello window (hello hello), well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely since our darling disappeared?
Well, look here, is that a teardrop in the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain

She went away and left us all alone, the way she planned
Yes, we'll have to learn to get along without her if we can

Hello ceiling (hello hello), I'm gonna stare at you awhile
You know I can't sleep, so won't you bear with me awhile?
We must all stick together or else I'll lose my mind
I've got a feeling she'll be gone a long, long time

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

ML861,Egypt Central,You Make Me Sick,"[Verse 1]
I used to think that this was perfect
And wish that it was never ending
But those days are gone forever
It's something I'm not missing
There's a force there's a voice in my head
Telling me to think
About the times that you were cruel and mean
And I don't care if you walk away
I'm here to stay and you need to hear

[Chorus]
You make me sick
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick
And I can't be the only one
You make me sick
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick
And I can't be the only one

[Verse 2]
I have to take advantage, before the moment passes by
It's so hard to manage, the ups and downs of your life
Someone help, someone speak, before I start to scream out
Anything to break the silence
You're holding me back, confined by doubt

[Chorus]
You make me sick
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick
And I can't be the only one
You make me sick
But I love what we're doing here
You make me sick
And I can't be the only one

'Cause I need you
'Cause I need you here with me
When it falls through
And I'm down upon my knees

There's a voice in my head
Telling me to think about everything
Last time I believed
Now I realize

You make me sick

You make me sick
And I can't be the only one
You make me sick
But I love what we're doing here

It ain't their fortune and fame
It ain't your heavy connections
It ain't the Hollywood game

Ain't famous people or the parties they throw
Honey I ain't impressed with all the people you know

It's just the way that you love me
(In the heat of the night)
It's just the way that you love me
(Baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(When you're loving me right)
It's just the way that you love me
(Baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(And the things that you do)
It's just the way that you love me
(Baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(Make me crazy for you)
It's just the way that you love me

It ain't the money or the diamond rings
Honey I ain't impressed with those material things

It ain't the trips to Brazil
It ain't the weekends in Rome
It ain't the French Riviera
You know I'd rather stay home

Ain't the Bahamas
It ain't Monaco
Honey I ain't impressed
With all the places we go

It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's just the way that you love me
The way that you love me
(It ain't the money)
It's just the way that you love me
(Or the diamond rings)
The way that you love me
(Ain't what you buy me baby)
It's just the way that you love me
(Ain't material things)
The way that you love me
(Ain't your Maserati)
It's just the way that you love me
(Your house on the hill)
The way that you love me
(It ain't the parties)
It's just the way that you love me

ML867,My Morning Jacket,Circuital,"Spinning out gracefully
Going nowhere quickly
I am older day by day
Still going back to my childhood way, ooh
Circuital
'Round and 'round patiently
Getting lost by the guide
And I am all worked up over nothing
Circuits
All running out
Connect my body
Deep into the ground
Circuits
Connect the Earth to the moon
And link our heavenly bodies
Not a moment too soon
Well, you can fling open the windows
Or you can board 'em up
Satan's jeweled crown
Or Christ's humble cup
You think you'll find yourself out there
Out in the lion's den
In some bloody battle
Over belief systems

Or disappear into the vacuum
Total neutrality
Where you can't lose nothing
But nothing can be gained
Well, anyway you cut it
We're just spinning 'round
Out on the circuit
Over the hallowed ground

Out on the circuit
Over the hallowed ground
Ending up in the same place
That we started out
Right back in the same place
Right back in the same place
That we started out"

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 2]
In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 3]
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 4]
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

[Verse 5]
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why

ML869,George Harrison,Isn't It A Pity,"[Verse 1]
Isn't it a pity?
Now isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

[Verse 2]
Some things take so long, but how do I explain
When not too many people can see we're all the same
And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see the beauty that surrounds them
Isn't it a pity?

[Verse 1]
Isn't it a pity?
Isn't it a shame?
How we break each other's hearts and cause each other pain
How we take each other's love without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?
Forgetting to give back
Now, isn't it a pity?

Ooh, you're giving me the fever tonight

I've seen you burn 'em before

You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder
Fire and ice
I wanna give you my love, but you'll just take a little piece of my heart
You'll just tear it apart

Moving in for the kill tonight
You got every advantage when they put out the lights
It's not so pretty when it fades away
'Cause it's just an illusion in this passion play
I've seen you burn 'em before

You come on like a flame, then you turn a cold shoulder

A crumb or two for my daily bread
Perhaps someday a kind soul will come along

Cracks in savers pass
And a white that sometimes shone

And you won't get hurt if you just keep your hands up
And stand tall like sycamores
Like sycamores

Sycamore got to grow down to grow up
Young roots toil the soil like baby's first cup

And say too green for the fire

All you want to do is be the fire part of fire
Like sycamores

There's sap in the trees if you tap 'em

In a bedside table with my jewelry
You still sleep in the bed with me

Corruption breeds the pedophile

""Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned""

Religion is hate
Religion is fear
Religion is war
Religion is rape

Jesus is pain
Jesus is gore
Jesus is the blood

Inside of the sobriety

Fuel the fire with the weed and the pills and the booze that will set me free
Throw it away, throw it away
This is my new reckoning
Now here me scream

The suffering
It burns like gasoline
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world of shame
Obscurity leads to severity
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world I hate
I self medicate

I am dizzy
From suffocating on the lies you feed
Deny deny your hope of sanity

Fuel the fire with the weed and the pills and the booze that will set me free
Throw me away, blow me away, throw me away
This is my new reckoning
Now here me scream

The suffering
It burns like gasoline
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world of shame
Obscurity leads to severity
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world I hate
I self medicate

Standing above myself and watching a part of me die
I see it all just starting to fade away
Though it's true I've always wondered
How I would say goodbye to myself

So now I fall again
And I can not pretend
There is no resurrection
So now I fall again
Now hear me scream

I am diseased
Can't take the pain I'd rather die than be alive
Inside of the sobriety
Fuel the fire with the weed and the pills and the booze that will set me free
Throw it away, throw it away, throw it away

The suffering
It burns like gasoline
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world of shame
Obscurity leads to severity
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world I hate
I self medicate"
ML888,Atreyu,Ex's And Oh's,"[Verse 1]
You took me home
I drank too much
'Cause of you my liver turned to dust
Cold rust taste
A cruel creeping cold pain
Do you understand what I mean?
When you feel your soul drop to the floor
Like a hole
Like an open bleeding sore
Then you'll have bled like I bled
And you'll have wept as I've wept

[Chorus]
Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll
Let's hit the bar, let's lose control
One false move, you took me home
One false move, you're all alone

[Verse 2]
But it looks so good and it feels so nice
I paid the price
I'll cut you out just to hear you scream
Get away from, get away from me
And I can feel my heartbeat racing
As I realize what I must do
Get away from
Get away from
Get away from you

[Bridge]
I should have turned and ran like hell
Last time I got the taste of you
I should have turned and ran like hell
And I'll see we're through
I should have turned and ran like hell
Last time I got the taste of you
I should have turned and ran like hell
And I'll see we're through
And I'll see we're through

[Interlude]
You fell upon me like a plague
Weakness, sweet weakness
But I digress after all this
You're just like all the rest

[Chorus]
Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll
Let's hit the bar, let's lose control
One false move, you took me home
One false move, you're all alone"

You bring me joy
When I'm down
Oh so much joy
When I lose my way, your love comes smiling on me
I saw your face and then I knew
We would be friends
I was so afraid but your eyes, they'd say, ""Come to me""
So I'd say to you
""Can we talk for a while?""
You'd say ""It's alright""
When you love me, I smile
I feel your heart and you feel mine
You bring me joy

[Verse 2]
You bring me joy
Don't go too far away
If I can't see your face, I will remember your smile

ML891,Anita Baker,Good Love,"[Verse 1]
On many days it goes unspoken
But this desire never seems to go away
It's gonna take much more than hope to bring you close
I think I'll pray

I hear you say you've got got a lot to give up
And there is so much more this heart of mine can take
If what you have to bring to me is positive
You send it right away
Right away

Words cannot say, heaven only knows

Lies

Turn around, they might be watching
And you never disappoint them
Hide your innocence before they see right through
You mustn't disappoint them

You need the danger just to feel your heart beat
You need to die just to find your identity
You need the knife just to know that you can bleed
You need the pain now just to feel anything

We fall in line
We live the lie
Give up, give up and feed the machine
It grows inside
Nowhere to hide
Give up, give up and feed the machine
Give up, give up and feed the machine

They pull you faster, the cadence calling
And you never fall behind
So choose a face your only calling out
You mustn't fall behind

You need another death just to have a life to save
You need a master just so you can beg
You need a light just because you're so afraid
Now bow down and learn to be a good slave

We fall in line
We live the lie
Give up, give up and feed the machine
It grows inside
Nowhere to hide
Give up, give up and feed the machine
Give up, give up and feed the machine

Go back to sleep

That’s in your hand
And the murder in front of you
Send out the wolves
The King is dead
Little pills taking over

This means war
Did the sun just burn out?
Leaving you all alone?

Living in a wicked world! (Wicked world!)
We’re living in a wicked world! (Wicked world!)

No one ever gets away

Love was the fuel
That drove your sin
When the Majesty followed you
The witches dance
The night begins
And the heart's taking over
The Royalty won’t wash away
It’s his scent that's inside of you
Off with her head
The Queen, she screams
Little pills taking over

This means war
Did the sun just burn out?
Leaving you all alone?

ML899,Blackguard,Firefight,"Oh, how is it we are cursed and reduced to this pandemonium?
Screams of the beings through the ash that I can see
Now do I beg the question, question the aggression
Of the suffering to be?
Why the single spark that made the flame that set this blaze

A blaze a blaze to quell our light and ignite the sky

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire, this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire, this is a firefight

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire, this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire, this is a firefight

The plume of black ash so gently caresses the sky
To the world I knew I say goodbye there are no more questions now
The lashes of flickering pain incandescent luminescent
As the brightest day, I feel my spirit slipping away

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night

This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight
No remorse or regret

Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire, this is a firefight

No mercy shown or debt was owed for what I cannot dream
The reason for this wrath bestowed by flame beyond the sea
Tonight I've heard the cry and swear by all I've seen
That vengeance will one day be mine satisfaction will I breathe

Have you seen your who world build from ash to ashes return

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire, this is a firefight

The flames that hold us
Are the same that hold the night
This was meant to choke the light
'Cause this is a fire this is a firefight

No remorse or regret
Ravenous contempt for the lives now spent
Now kiss the blaze and cry
This is a fire, this is a firefight"

We love you (We love you)
You will never win we
Your uniforms don't fit we
We forget the place we're in
'Cause we love you (We love you)
Of course we do

I love you
I love you
And I hope that you are grooving, too

ML905,Bob Marley & The Wailers,War,"[Verse 1]
Until the philosophy which hold one race
Superior and another Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war

[Verse 2]
That until there are no longer
First-class and second-class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
Me say war

[Verse 3]
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

[Verse 4]
That until that day
The dream of lasting peace
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained
Now everywhere is war
War

[Verse 5]
And until the ignoble and unhappy regime
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war
Me say war

[Chorus]
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

[Verse 6]
War, war
Rumors of war
And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight, we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil

[Outro]
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!"

Last night I hurt you
But darlin', remember this
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again, mmm

You know I'm sorry
I'll prove it with just one kiss
Only love can break a heart
Only love can mend it again

Give me a chance to
Make up for the harm I've done
Try to forgive me
And let's keep the two of us one

Please let me hold you
And love you for always and always

ML907,John Hiatt,What Kind Of Man,"I cheated on my love
I cheated on my taxes
Burned bridges, ground axes

I stole cars, I stole dope
Left scars, killed hope

What kind of man do you think I am, babe?
One twist and I'd do it all again, babe
What kind of man got these holes in his mind?
Do the same thing over and over again
Expecting something different this time
What kind of man do you think I am?

I'm livin' in your house
I'm holdin' your hand
Sleepin' in your bed
Cookin' in your pan

You see the man who loves you
You see the man you love
But I have hidden claws
Inside these gloves

What kind of man do you think I am?
One twist and I'd do it all again
What kind of man got these holes in his mind?
Do the same thing over and over again
Expecting it'd be different this time
What kind of man do you think I am? Give it

Come clean and stand tall
To thee thine own self be true
But sometimes I don't know
Who's foolin' who

It's not place to question
Not my place to know
Now tell me
What kind of man gonna run this kind of show?

What kind of man do you think I am, babe?
Another thing comin' if you think I can, babe?
Pick you up every chance I get
Well, I've broken your heart for no other reason
Than my mind was already set
Oh, what kind of man?
What kind of man do you think I am?

What? What? What?
What kind of man do you think I am?
Oh, what kind of man?
What kind of man do you think I am?

That says the sun has to always shine
That everybody gets the chance to say

ML919,Billie Holiday,Nice Work If You Can Get It,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if
Won't you tell me how?"

Go down to Killey's and we make some noise

And having some fun and acting a fool
But this time I won't be going where they are

'Cause I'm going home and rock my baby
Just thinkin' 'bout her is making me crazy
And all day long, I've been dreamin' of holdin' her tight

Candle light and love-me-tender
I'm going home and rock my baby tonight

I thank she's ready for some R&R
Something to take her mind off everything
Champagne and a box of candy
A dozen roses might come in handy
To help loosen up those apron strings

Tomorrow, I may have to call in sick

Yo sé bien que estoy afuera

Sé que tendrás que llorar

Dirás que no me quisiste
Pero vas a estar muy triste
Y así te vas a quedar

Y mi palabra es La Ley
No tengo trono ni reina
Ni nadie que me comprenda
Pero sigo siendo El Rey

Una piedra del camino
Me enseñó que mi destino
Era rodar y rodar
(Rodar y rodar, rodar y rodar)
Después me dijo un arriero
Que no hay que llegar primero
Pero hay que saber llegar

Ni nadie que me comprenda

Para buscarte en lugares que me ofendes
Quisiera estar en donde estas ahorita mismo
Para arrancarte de los brazos en donde duermes

Tu eres el sol con que se alumbra mi existir
Tu eres el agua con que se apaga mi sed
Tu eres el aire que respiro pa vivir
Tu eres la tierra donde al fin descansare

Si me emborracho pa olvidarte ni te olvido
Es que en el fondo de mi copa te estoy viendo
Y en el fondo de la copa tu te burlas
Con esa risa que me mata el pensamiento

And I believe the only reason why
I'm still alive is
God must really love me

Wake up and feel you by my side
The perfect girl, the perfect time
And see the way our future shines
God must really love me

When I look at the miracles around me
At the dream that I live and the gift that he gives
I know he's up there smiling down on me
And I believe the only reason why
I get to live this life is God must really love me

When I showed the worst, He saw the best
He pulled the world right off my chest
Every day I wake up I feel blessed
Yeah, I feel so blessed
God must really love me
God must really love me
God must really love me"
ML946,Alan Jackson,Ring Of Fire,"[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

[Chorus][x2]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire[x3]"
ML947,David Kersh,Goodnight Sweetheart,"Window Seat 30,000 Feet Above The Ground
Blue Moon Beams On Silver Wings Bring Me Down
Slipping Off my coat for the long night flight
I find a note she wrote last night
I can almost hear those words as I close my eyes

Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are
God hold you in his arms while we're apart
Tho your far away your love will stay tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight wherever you are

These days I leave, the one who needs me more and more it seems
Its a high price that she pays for the dreams I dream

So Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are
God hold u in his arms while we're apart
Tho your far away your love will stay tucked away herre in my heart
Goodnight Sweetheart sleep tight wherever you are"
ML948,Robert Earl Keen,Something I Do,"I am the king of burning daylight, holdin' my own
I've been doin' alright, leaving well enough alone
My Daddy told me I was lazy, my momma said, I love you too

I kind of like just, doin' nothing
It's something that I do
I kind of like just, doin' nothing
It's something that I do

I read the sports page, make some coffee, turn the TV on
I feed the gold fish, fix a sandwich, ignore the telephone
My baby tells me, you're so lazy, my baby say we love you too

I kind of like just, doin' nothing
It's something that I do
(He kind of likes just doin' nothing)
It's something that I do

I got a cabin and a campfire, stars up in the sky (""sky"" echoes)
I got a ummm, good hearted woman, I think I'm getting by
I tell my baby, I am the walrus, my baby says Goo goo g'joob

I kind of like just, doin' nothing
It's something that I do
(He kind of likes just doin' nothing)
It's something that I do

Alright
(Instrumental)

I love a clear day, an open highway, a lonesome fiddle tune
I love a party, with friends and family, napping in the afternoon
I might be lazy, I ain't crazy, I love my baby, she loves me too

I kind of like (he kind of likes just), just doin' nothing
It's something that I do
I kind of like (he kind of likes just), just doin' nothing
It's something that I do
(He kind of likes just doin' nothing)
It's something that I do
(He kind of likes just doin' nothing)
It's something that I do
Alright"

ML951,Reckless Kelly,Some People's Kids,"Her daddy told her all the facts
His mama taught him how to act
At puberty they paid their dues
The pool hall was the Moulin Rouge

And he likes her skirt
And she like his tight levi's
Fannin' flames of the fire
That burned higher than the fire in their eyes

Mama's downtown on her lips
Daddy's on a business trip
A pinch from Mama's treasure chest
Daddy comes up with the rest

And some people's kids don't know how fast time flies
Now they're payin' for the fire burnin' higher than the fire in their eyes

Some people's kids can't see
All some people's kids really need
Is someone to be there
To love 'em and to care, about them

Daddy was a rollin' stone
Mama chose to live alone
Susie's out there on the wine
Jimmy was friend of mine

And some people's kids gotta sing so it's no surprise
That the flame of the fire's burnin' higher than the fire in their eyes"

And lightning in His fist

Well, the Lord wasn't joking
When He kicked 'em out of Eden
It wasn't for no reason that He shed his blood
His return is very close and so you better be believing
That our God is an awesome God

Our God(our God) is an awesome God
He reigns(He reigns) from heaven above
With wisdom(with wisdom) pow'r and love
Our God is an awesome God

And when the sky was starless in the void of the night
(our God is an awesome God)
He spoke into the darkness and created the light
(our God is an awesome God)
Judgment and wrath he poured out on Sodom
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an awesome God

Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
All alone in my bed at night

All of the time, what am I gonna do?

Just one chance and I will show you love
Like no other, two steps above
And on your ladder, I'll be a peg
I want your lovin', please don't make me beg

And you never see his face
But there is no hiding place

It's too far gone, these sheets tell of regret
I admit that I'm just a fool for you

Do exactly what you want to

Here is where we both go wrong
So sign me up and toss this key
'Cause for now we're living

It's all over, it's all over
I feel your heart against mine
So take a breath and close your eyes, eyes

Sordid remains, adorn morbid sanctuary
Lechery addiction, your celestial charms
A glorified impulse, seven severed arteries

Spit upon a dew drenched breast

ML964,Terri Clark,I Just Wanna  Be Mad,"Last night we went to bed not talking
'Cause we'd already said too much
I faced the wall, you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch

We've been married seven years now
Some days it feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since five
Thinking about me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that

Floating high above the trees one night
Thought it was an alien
Turned out to be just God

Who has better reasons to deceive?
They're really good at that
That's all they do

ML967,Jane Monheit,I'm Glad There Is You,"In this world of ordinary people, extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you
In this world of overrated pleasures, of underrated treasures
I'm so glad there is you

I live to love, I'll love to live with you beside me
This role so new I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where very many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever I'm glad there is you

I live to love, I'll love to live with you beside me
This role so new I'll muddle through with you to guide me

And hardly any stay in love

Let me get this down
But I'd better hear the same thing

There's no smoke without fire

The alibi you sold me
You know it ain't water tight
A little birdie told me
And I got you dead to right
No one's calling you a liar but
There's no smoke without fire

Darling please believe me
Cross my heart you said
But when I turned around
You had your fingers crossed instead
No one's calling you a liar but
There's no smoke without fire

Before the judge gets back
No one's calling you a liar but
There's no smoke without fire"

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby

Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why oh why can't I?"

For your love
I would go anywhere

My suitcase and guitar in hand

For a poet and a one man band

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Everyday's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines, Mmm
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting
Silently for me

Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend, mmm
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me

Homeward bound
Home, where my thought's escaping
Home, where my music's playing
Home, where my love lies waiting

Before you go and tell your tales
You better think things true

So speak no evil, Evil won't happen to you

I've been mad enough to kill someone
But I couldn't face the task
So I tried to shout them down
With this big mouth of mine

So speak no evil, evil will get you in time

I've been about ..... that that shouldn't mess with you
Every time that I lied, you know I mean to tell the truth
No matter where I go , no matter what I do or say
Somebody gonna telling me, when they oughtta back away

Words thrown out in anger, always come back to haunt you
Once they go they told me, talk so hard to undo
So speak no evil, evil will come back to you
Better speak no evil, evil will come back to you"
ML990,Kurt Elling,Matte Kudasai,"Still by the window pane
Pain like the rain that's falling
She waits in the air, Matte Kudasai
She sleeps in a chair in her sad America

When, when was a night so long?
Long like the notes I'm sending
She waits in the air, Matte Kudasai
She sleeps in a chair in her sad America

She waits in the air, Matte Kudasai
She sleeps in a chair in her sad America"

Rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go
Anywhere the lights are low
Going where the lonely go

Making up things to do
Not running in all directions trying to find you
I'm just rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go

[Verse 3]
And I've got to keep going
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around

[Verse 4]
I've got to keep going
Traveling down this lonesome road
And I'll be rolling with the flow
Going where the lonely go

I've got to keep going
I can't lay down
Sleep won't hardly come
Where there's loneliness all around

Going where the lonely go"
ML992,Johnny Cash,Rusty Cage,"[Verse 1]
You wired me awake
And hit me with a hand of broken nails
You tied my lead and pulled my chain
To watch my blood begin to boil

But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run

Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to Stillwater
And ride a pack of dogs

[Chorus]
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run
[Verse 3]
When the forest burns along the road
Like God's eyes in my headlights
When the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining ice picks on your steel shore

[Chorus]
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
Gonna break my rusty cage and run

When I was a young boy
My momma said to me
Once a woman gets your soul
You'll never shake her free
These are words of wisdom
It turns out she was right
Gotta find a lover
'Cause I need a fix tonight

Oh, you're such a pretty thing
I'll take you and I'll make you all mine
I will steal you from this patient world
Let it chase us, it could never take you back

And I know you know me well enough
To know I'm lucky to have you

When you beat me in doubles solitaire
You're so sweet to me
In a world that's not always fair

ML998,Robbie Robertson,He Don't Live Here No More,"Got a ticket on the mainline
I was stranded on the fault line
I got wasted on the moonshine
Too far gone

I was walking in the sundown
I was heading for the breakdown
When you're sleeping on the cold ground
Too far gone

There was a cloud hanging over me
Something just reached out and grabbed a hold of me

Inside of the belly of the whale
Outside they was beatin on the door
Somebody goin down tonight
I said boys he don't live here no more
He don't live here no more

I was riding on the night train
I been moving in the fast lane
I was only trying to kill the pain
Too far gone

I was running on a red light

Always looking for a street fight
I was higher than a lost kite
Too far gone

When you're waiting for the axe to drop
When you're hooked so bad you could not stop

Inside of the belly of the whale
Outside they was beatin on the door
Somebody goin down tonight
I said boys he don't live here no more
He don't live here no more

Got no one to blame but myself
They couldn't hear my distant cry for help

Inside of the belly of the whale
Outside they was beatin on the door
Somebody's goin down tonight
I said boys he don't live here no more
He don't live here no more"
ML999,Stereophonics,Maybe Tomorrow,"[Verse 1]
I've been down, and I'm wondering why
These little black clouds keep walking around
With me
With me
It wastes time, and I'd rather be high
Think I'll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile
But be free
They're all free

[Chorus]
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

[Verse 2]
I look around at a beautiful life
I've been the upper side of down, been the inside of out
But we breathe
We breathe
I want a breeze and an open mind
I wanna swim in the ocean, wanna take my time
For me
All me

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

Well, someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere

I couldn't live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart

So lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely

Now no one's knocked upon my door

All made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this one-man show
Just take a seat, they're always free
No surprise, no mystery
In this theatre that I call my soul
I always play the starring role

Outta luck and out of rules
No one there to tell me how
A different world, teacher teach me now

Fire on the bayou

Down in New Orleans, in Lucky's din
He wouldn't deal y'all for a 5th of gin
One dude wanted a bottle of wine
Hit that dude yes he did up for a dollar and a dime

Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou

Take a little toke on your smoke
Buy yourself a bottle of wine
Cool, cool wine going down your throat
Don't try and tell me don't make you feel fine

Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou

I got a nickel now, you got a dime
Let's get together and have a good time
Goin' to buy a fifth, going to buy a joint
When you gettin' down now, you doin' things right""

The Mississippi River can't be tamed
I pole my pirogue in the middle of the night
I'm an uptown ruler, I can do it right"""

ML1012,La Ley,Aqui,"[Letra de ""Aquí""]

El hombre esta acercándose
Hacia el encuentro con la frontera
Un cambio, una decisión
La puerta abierta de una nueva era

El mundo que gira al revés
Pretende que navegue en él
Ahogando mis ideas

El ruido, ambiente y soledad
De la ciudad nos aíslan de todo
Por eso comencé a escarbar
Para encontrar los mil y un tesoros

El mundo que gira al revés
Pretende sumergirme en él
Ahogando mis ideas

Aquí tengo el presentimiento
Que aquí nada voy a arrastrar desde aquí
Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

Lamento hay en mi corazón
No es imaginación, es verdadero
Mientras el tiempo anuncia que
Por un segundo casi fui un señuelo

El mundo que gira al revés
Pretende que me encienda en él
Quemando mis ideas

Cuando hasta un ciego puede ver
Que nos callamos sin saber
Perdiéndonos la vuelta

Aquí tengo el presentimiento
Que aquí nada voy a arrastrar desde aquí
Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

Cuando hasta un ciego puede ver
Que nos callamos sin saber
Perdiéndonos la vuelta

Aquí tengo el presentimiento
Que aquí nada voy a arrastrar desde aquí
Solo voy a vivir mi hoy ahora

Aquí"

Me llevó a conocerte

Tú no me puedes engañar

Yo no voy a entrar por la puerta de atras
Y yo no quiero jugar tu juego de azar
Y yo no soy tu muñeca inflable
Que pierde muy pronto el aire
No empieces a hablarme de amor
Porque yo sin ti Sobrevivo!...

Te quemas con tu boca
No me importa tu nombre
Me divierto por ahora
No te hagas ilusiones

Tu no me puedes engañar
Yo se q tu solamente quieres
Arrancarme el corazon

Yo no voy a entrar por la puerta de atras
Y yo no quiero jugar tu juego de azar

No me asusta el destino
Porque no necesito de nadie

[Verso 1]
Quizás te puedas preguntar
Qué le hace falta a esta noche blanca
A nuestras vidas que ya han vivido tanto
Que han visto mil colores de sábanas de seda
Y cuando llueve te gusta caminar
Vas abrazándome sin prisa aunque te mojes
Amor mío, lo nuestro es como es
Es toda una aventura, no le hace falta nada

[Coro]
Estoy aquí, tan enamorado de ti
Que la noche dura un poco más
El grito de una ciudad
Que ve nuestras caras la humedad
Y te haré compañía más allá de la vida
Yo te juro que arriba te amaré más
Tan enamorados que así
La noche dura un poco más

[Verso 2]
La mañana nos traerá un canto nuevo de pájaros alegres
Amor mío, así es la vida juntos
Dos locos de repente
Sonriéndole a la gente que nos ve pasar

[Coro]
Tan enamorados que así
La noche dura un poco más
Viajar a tu lado en el tren
Un sueño difícil de creer
Poco a poco el abrazo
Boca a boca, despacio
Aliento y suspiros tibios, anochecer
Tan enamorados que así
La noche dura un poco más
Viajar a tu lado en el tren
Un sueño difícil de creer"

[Verso 1]
Ya no quiero oírlo otra vez
Mi alma está partida en dos por ti
No me importa el fuego en el que ardo hoy
Dicen que estoy enferma de amor
Que me levanto y vuelvo a caer por ti
Cada vez que te apareces frente a mí

Porque sin ti no hay camino
Ni destino, estoy perdida
Porque sin ti no me importan
Los minutos ni los días
Porque sin ti no hay presente
Ni futuro, sálvame
De esta bella traición
Que mató mi razón (Que mató mi razón)

[Verso 2]
Perdona si me olvido de ti
Lo siento si agoté la ilusión
No me importa el juramento que te dí
Me dicen que tu amor terminó
Que sólo eres una canción de ayer
Un suspiro que en el aire se quedó

[Coro]
Porque sin ti no hay camino
Ni destino, estoy perdida
Porque sin ti no me importan
Los minutos ni los días
Porque sin ti no hay presente
Ni futuro, sálvame
De esta bella traición
Que mató mi razón (Que mató mi razón)

[Puente]
Dónde estarás
Cuando mis labios te busquen?
Y dónde estará
El sueño tan dulce que
Era de los dos?
Fuiste mi bella traición
Fuiste mi bella traición

Ni destino, estoy perdida
Porque sin ti no me importan
Los minutos ni los días
Porque sin ti no hay presente
Ni futuro, sálvame

ML1021,Braids,Lemonade,"I don't want to go out there
I don't want to know what you're wearing
There are black diamonds in your eyes
And just so you know your skin is scaling

Have you fucked all the stray kids yet?
They're there sleeping in my backyard
They're just looking out for no one
Except to smoke and have some good fun
With their dogs and wives and new sons
And they probably never will hug
'cause she's never really found love
Just a woman who will always love
Just a unhappy with a man

And what I, and what I found is that we
We're all just sleeping around

His daughter used to come here

With her daughter and her husband
Now no one sees her husband
'Cause her ass has caught the harvest
And her pants have got a good fill
I know the suns beneath the window sill

Well I was joking with my lemonade
I told him to get fucked and then get laid
Now what do you say to a man who's got no taste
Who's really got no potential
Except to procreate so inessential

And what I, and what I found is that we
We're all just sleeping around

All we really want to do is love"

Static cool
My heart and soul

A white horse
Sitting right there by her side
Hard to ignore
Hard to disguise
She'll never ever
Realize

And it's fired his money

A thousand cigarettes went nuts
The stranger's hand in mine went white
Smudged lipstick, feeling sick
Make out, fall out, make up

Make out, fall out, make up, fall out

Dancing in the living room
With light supplied by the moon
Things I've said but shouldn't
Tricks I've tried but couldn't

Sorry if the music's too loud
Now the air is thicker than the cloud
Did I really call you
I was looking for someone I knew

Make out, fall out, make up, fall out
Fall out (fades) Make up fall out!"

Givin' everything you've got
After all the heartache
Maybe give love just one more shot, yeah

In a lonely night
And in the pourin' rain
The only thing I really wanna know is why

Sometimes she cries
When she's alone at night
Sometimes she weeps
Oh, when she's feelin' cold and weak
Sometimes the pain
Oh, it tears her up inside
Sometimes she cries

Oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah"
ML1036,Enya,Amarantine,"[Verse 1]
You know when you give your love away
It opens your heart, everything is new
And you know time will always find a way
To let your heart believe it's true

[Verse 2]
You know love is everything you say;
A whisper, a word
Promises you give
You feel it in the heartbeat of the day
You know this is the way love is

[Chorus]
Amarantine, amarantine, amarantine
Love is, love is... love
Amarantine, amarantine, amarantine
Love is, love is... love

[Verse 3]
You know love may sometimes make you cry
So let the tears go, they will flow away
For you know love will always let you fly
How far a heart can fly away

[Chorus]
Amarantine, amarantine, amarantine
Love is, love is... love
Amarantine, amarantine, amarantine
Love is, love is... love
Amarantine, amarantine, amarantine
Love is, love is... love

[Verse 4]
You know when love's shining in your eyes
It may be the stars, fallen from above
And you know love is with you when you rise
For night and day belong to love"
ML1037,Andy Andy,Que Ironia,"[Letra de ""Que ironía""]

[Verso 1]
Con él en la ciudad, con él paseas
Con él vas a volar, conmigo juegas
Con él siempre con el, y yo estoy solo
Y no me siento bien cuando me pongo loco
Con el siempre con el, y yo estoy harto
No me siento bien con el papel de un santo
Esto es así, de cualquier modo
Tú te vas con él y yo me quedo solo

[Estribillo]
Y mira qué ironía, querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo te ofrezco mi vida
Con sólo una mirada
Y mira qué ironía querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo soy a tu medida
El único que te ama

[Intermisión]
-Hello, hello?
+Soy yo
-Hola mi amor
+¿Puedes hablar?
-Quisiera pero no puedo
+¿Por qué no?
-Sorry, I've gotta go, I've gotta go

[Verso 2]
Con él siempre con él y yo estoy solo
No me siento bien porque no soy un tonto
Esto es así, de cualquier modo
Tu intimas con el y yo me quedo solo
Con el siempre con el y yo en silencio
Como puedo ser así tu amor secreto
Esto es así, de cualquier modo
Tú te vas con él y yo me quedo solo

[Estribillo]
Y mira qué ironía, querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo te ofrezco mi vida
Con sólo una mirada
Y mira qué ironía querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo soy a tu medida
El único que te ama

[Puente]
Y ya no puedo más
Esta batalla no es igual

[Estribillo]
Y mira qué ironía, querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo te ofrezco mi vida
Con sólo una mirada
Y mira qué ironía querida
Él no te entrega nada
En cambio yo soy a tu medida
El único que te ama"

Well, some need the power
Some bleed in vain
Some get a bullet in the head, instead

We like it loud, we like it loud

Shellshock

[Chorus]
Hold on! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
Until your heart

[Verse 1]
You call me on the phone, you left me all alone
All I get from you is shellshock
Another day goes by and all I do is cry
All I get from you is shellshock
I'd tell the world and save my soul
But rain falls down and I feel cold
A cold that sleeps within my heart
It tears the Earth and Sun apart
But that's the way (that’s the way) I can win (ah)
A victim of (that’s the way) your evil sin (ah)
You've lost the hold (that’s the way) you've had on me (ah)
By causing the changes that you never see

[Chorus]
Hold on! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
On! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
On!
Until your heart

[Verse 2]
When we walk through open doorways
Counting time in one or more ways
We can't find our peace of mind
And life becomes a life of crime
And that's the day (that’s the way) I call your name (ah)
I came to you, (that’s the way) I called in vain (ah)
You lost the faith (that’s the way) within your heart (ah)
The fire in your soul from the end to the start

[Chorus]
Hold on! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
On!
Until your heart, until your heart

That’s the way

[Verse 3]
I've been good and I've been bad
But common sense I've never had
No matter how I try and try
I hide the truth behind a lie
But that's the way (that’s the way) that I can win (ah)
A victim of (that’s the way) your evil sin (ah)
You lost the faith (that’s the way) within your heart (ah)
The fire in your soul from the end to the start

[Chorus]
Hold on! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
On! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
On! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
On! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating
On! It's never enough
It's never enough until your heart stops beating
The deeper you get, the sweeter the pain
Don't give up the game until your heart stops beating"

ML1053,The Cowsills,"The Rain, The Park And Other Things","[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I saw her sitting in the rain
Raindrops falling on her
She didn't seem to care
She sat there and smiled at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I knew (I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew)
She could make me happy (Happy, happy)
(She could make me very happy)
Flowers in her hair (In her hair)
Flowers everywhere (Everywhere)

[Chorus]
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
Oh, I don't know just why
She simply caught my eye
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
She seemed so sweet and kind
She crept into my mind
To my mind (To my mind)

[Verse 2]
I knew I had to say hello (Hello, hello)
She smiled up at me (Hello, how do you do?)
And she took my hand
And we walked through the park alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I knew (I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew)
She had made me happy (Happy, happy)
(She had made me very happy)
Flowers in her hair (In her hair)
Flowers everywhere (Everywhere)

[Chorus]
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
Oh, I don't know just why
She simply caught my eye
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
She seemed so sweet and kind
She crept into my mind
To my mind (To my mind)

[Verse 3]
Suddenly, the sun broke through (See the sun)
I turned around, she was gone
(Where did she go?) And all I had left
Was one little flower in my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
But I knew (I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew)
She had made me happy (Happy, happy)
(She had made me very happy)
Flowers in her hair (In her hair)
Flowers everywhere (Everywhere)

[Alternate Chorus]
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
Was she reality
Or just a dream to me?
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
Her love showed me the way
To find a sunny day
Sunny day (Sunny day, sunny day)

[Outro]
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
Was she reality
Or just a dream to me?
I love the flower girl (I love the flower girl)
Was she reality..."

Una inquietante mirada de amor porteño
Cálida y cruel
No, no puedo creer que pasó
Que el misterio sensual de tu risa canyengue
Se apagó

Brindo por esa ilusión de amor porteño
Loco puñal
Dulce y fatal, la nostalgia de un tiempo pedazo de nosotros dos
Y yo que pensaba que no me importaba
Que una caricia podía borrar el color
De mi ciudad

El código oculto de esa mirada
Es como una señal
Y no puedo zafar
Un deseo sutil que temblando me viene a buscar

In my dreams, she holds me tight

I sit and dream of a starry night

I'll always mourn that cloudy day

Reanimated selfishly
Arise evil one, kill for me

Now I'm your lord

ML1075,Lamb Of God,Black Label,"The human confrontation, I've built a phobia
It takes my essence somewhere
Somewhere to take control

I may be far from rocking
I am the one alone
I may be far behind lines
And made them turn away

I want to know, hey you watch out!
I've made them turn to cripple, hey you watch out!
When I will know, who'll know, back fight!
Why time would let me die to control

I fear nothing, why don't you know
I rip my mind and why don't you bleed
I fear no one, why you turn back
I may not stop

My freedom can't contain but tell me
The pain I liberate
Riff hostility to anyone
Has made us so much hate
I made them turn from hate but tell me
The pain and suffering
I made them turn from hate but tell me
The pain and suffering
I know"

All the wrong things to be said
We've said 'em
We let anger guide the way
I say you're at fault you say I'm selfish
Now the accusations must be paid with the

Strain of losing you
Pain of feeling blue
You're hurt and I'm lost
Tell me what are we gonna do?

Please come back and kiss away the pain
We can be happy once again
Please come back and kiss away the pain
We can make sunshine from the rain

Without you my life has no music
Rhyme and rhythm cease to be
Close friends tell me that you're acting heartsick
Is it all because you're missing me?

The pain is clouding your eyes
Pain too deep to disguise
You're blue, baby, I am too
Tell me, tell me, tell me what are we gonna do?

(Please come back and kiss away the pain)
Please come back and kiss it away
I'm talkin' about pain, baby
We can be happy once again
(Please come back and kiss away the pain)
Please come back and kiss it away
I'm talkin' bout pain baby
We can make sunshine from the rain

Please come back baby
Please come back baby, kiss it away
We don't even have to explain
Please come back and kiss away my pain
Lost love is such, such a shame

(Please come back and kiss away the pain)

Your kiss is guaranteed to take all the pain
Take all the pain, take all the pain away from me
Please
Please
Please

Take it away

Take it away"

And foolish though it may seem, to me that’s everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You’ll never know how slow the moments go till I’m near to you
I see your face in every flower, your eyes in stars above
It’s just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my love

Just the thought of you, the very thought of you, my dear"

ML1089,Ed Bruce,The Last Cowboy Song,"This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

He rides a feed lot and clerks in a market
On weekends selling tobacco and beer
His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball Ol' Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down

This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis L'Amour has told us his tale
And Willie and Waylon and me sing about him
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail

The Old Chisholm Trail is covered in concrete now
And they truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigs
They blow by his market never slowing to reason
Like living and dying was all he did
This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost
This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

This is the last cowboy song the end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost"

Your love's contagious
One kiss is dangerous
But I have more to risk than you to lose

[Verse 2]
I feel passion growin'
I know that love is only
Just one inch away from striking us

We live for love
We live for love

[Verse 3]
When we get tired
And watch the summer fade away
Will you think of romance? What will we do?

[Verse 4]
Is there a place where we can go
Where time stands still for those who know?
'Til eternity, we'll fulfill our desire

[Chorus]
We live for love
We live for love
We live for love
We live for love

You ain't in

Where you been?
Ooh baby
Layin' it on the line
If this is last call
And you say that's all you can take
It's fine

I'm sorry but
It don't make sense
You'd be a fool
If you just run out on first offense
Ooh baby play it smart
Before you go south with your big mouth
Better check your heart

Maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down

No more lying
No more tears a falling
Stop your cryin'

Before you go back to your side track
Baby understand

And just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn.. might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down

ML1096,Gorillaz,Broken,"[Verse 1]
Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
Then dive as deep as they can

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is in outer heart
And the space has been broken

[Chorus]
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

[Verse 2]
Is it far away
In the Glitter Freeze
Or in our eyes
Every time they meet
It's by the light
Of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

[Chorus]
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken
It's Broken
Our love
It's Broken

But you'll never see the light again in his smile

Now you are gone, are they moving on?
Don't listen girl
Listen what they say

Got no soul, got no rock and roll
And he'll never hold me in his arms again
I'm so cold

And I heard you say I heard you say
Almost took my breath away

No, he will never hold me in his arms again
He'll never hold me in his arms again
I'm so cold

Almost took my breath away

No, he'll never hold me in his arms again

ML1100,36 Crazyfists,The All Night Lights,"Yeah

Forever we'll go out into the night with survival in all our eyes
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of an age when we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

Like lions we tow the line, blood sewn pact with truth inside
With knives in hand we stab at the sands of time
To turn back and unwind
Under the death of age, we were becoming stronger than...
With terror in our eyes, we wait on these skies to bring a new chapter

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

We will rise (rise)
(rise) rise again
(again) we will

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

I've seen life through death, under the weight of it all, we all collapse
And these eyes on survive, we will come from the fall and rise again

Fall to your knees, accomplishing nothing
Fall to your knees, only to exercise your schedule
Abandon calendar
(What has come with such preaching is loneliness)
Profit: Zero
Achievement: Zero

[Chorus: Mike Hranica]
Forward can't be stopped
It just goes to show that some words are useless
It just goes to show that some words are useless
Take all your medals
Take all your ribbons
Take all your awards
Take them, take them back to the ground

[Verse 3: Mike Hranica & Jeremy DePoyster]
Our youth is lost;
A product of the created circumstances
All I can say is ""maybe""
(All I can say is maybe this is what I've been expecting all along)
Now's the time of weakness
Now's the time of blood
Perhaps even the whole-hearted had wished for this

[Breakdown: Mike Hranica]
Now's the time of weakness
Now's the time of blood
And still the time of lions
Push everything
Force everything

We've all sung of the end
But who truly understands it?

Take all your ribbons
Take all your awards

The stars turned upside down
It knocked me to the ground on my knees

Now there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me
There's a sad lookin' sky
As far as I can see
I always believed
And I thought the stars could see
But there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me

I shared with you my dreams
I gave you everything
I opened up my heart
And I gave you my ring
Well I spent days and nights
Just thinkin' about the time
When you would be mine all my life

Now there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me
There's a sad lookin' sky
As far as I can see
I always believed
And I thought the stars could see
But there's a sad lookin' moon
Shinin' down on me

So sing to me, baby, I'm a sing to you
Stay true to me lady, I'll stay true to you

Rain or shine
You always got my back
Take me to cloud nine

Y que una nube de tu memoria me borre a mí
Y allá en el otro mundo
En vez de infierno encuentres gloria
Y que una nube de tu memoria me borre a mí

Dile a quien te pregunte que no te quise
Dile que te engañaba, que fuí lo peor
Echame a mí la culpa de lo que pase
Cubrete tu la espalda con mi dolor

Como me gusta lo bueno
El negocio hay que cuidarlo

Live life the master of my destiny, see no other way to live

I am not the weak willed
Nor am I a fool who can not see
I am not the weak willed
I will not let pride destroy me

Wise men can see the
Difference in compromise
And laying down ones beliefs
There shall be wisdom in my beliefs

They shall be rooted in strength not failure
With lies on your tongue seek to deceive
You've fallen victim to the human condition
And it's lead to your defeat

I am not the weak willed
Nor am I a fool who can not see
I am not the weak willed
I will not let pride destroy me
I will not let pride destroy me"

Hustling kids there jugglin pot
Listen, young man, listen to my plan
Gonna make you money, gonna make you a man
Bom bom here's what you get: an M-16 and a kevlar vest
You might come home with one less leg but this thing will surely keep a bullet out your chest

So, come on, come on, sign up, come on
This one's nothing like Vietnam
Except for the bullets, except for the bombs, except for the youth that's gone

Tellin you that they support the troops

And don't let them fool you with their milk and honey
No, they only want your money

One step forward and two steps back
One step forward and two steps back
Why do veterans get no respect
PTSD and a broken back

Take a look at where your money's gone seen
Take a look at what they spend it on
No excuses, no illusions

My kind of town, Chicago is
My kind of razzmatazz
And it has all that jazz

The Union Stockyard, Chicago is
One town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town!"

My love and I did meet
She crossed the salley gardens
With little snow-white feet

She bid me to take life easy
As the leaves grow on the tree
But I was young and foolish
And with her I did not agree

In a field down by the river
My love and I did stand
And upon my leaning shoulder
She laid her snow-white hand

She bid me take life easy
As the grass grows on the weirs
But I was young and foolish
And now I am full of tears

It was down by the salley gardens
My love and I did meet
She crossed the salley gardens
With little snow-white feet

She bid me to take life easy
As the leaves grow on the tree
But I was young and foolish
And with her I did not agree"

Hit the streets
They talk to me

It's such a waste, another day
Such a waste, But it feels great
But it feels great

It feels great

Everything has taken a turn
In disguise as what I want
I can leave her
I cantilever
But I keep coming back for more

I'm turning into something
Go all the way to the right
I'm going past, I'm going past, I'm going past the next two lights

You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers

Too close now to change it
Fool's gold is lighter anyway

Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah

Go!

ML1132,Whitney Houston,Miracle,"[Verse 1]
How could I throw away a miracle?
How could I face another day?
It's all of my doing, I made a choice
And today, I pay
My heart is full of pain
How could you understand, the way I feel?
How could you relate to so much pain?
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today, I pray
That someone should listen, for

[Chorus]
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store

[Verse 2]
How could I let go of a miracle?
Nothing could ever take its place
Thought I was looking out for myself
Now it seems the pain
Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle
I wonder if I could spare you pain
Seems as though nothing will comfort me
Lord, less today, I pray
That you should come listen, for

[Chorus]
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store

[Bridge]
Don't ever throw away your miracle
Don't let it slip away
Nothing should matter

[Chorus]
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
The choice is yours
There's a miracle in store
Nothing should matter
Not when love grows inside you
A voice of love is crying out
Don't throw love away
There's a miracle in store, for you

ML1133,Drive-By Truckers,Everybody Needs Love,"The moonbeams we can dream on, when the working day is done
There's stars we can wish upon, at the setting of the sun
The sunsets we can cry over, put our trouble's on the run
But more than all these miracles above, good people, we got love

Everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun, moon and stars up above

A'int nobody ever found happiness, living their lives all alone
I used to go around like I didn't need nobody, to be me happy and alone
And one sad day I found myself in trouble, way down without a friend
Along came the love of a real good woman, said she'd love me 'til the end

Everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and all the stars up above

Everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun the stars up above

Everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love, love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Just like they need the sun and moon and stars up above

Everybody, everybody everybody needs love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love"

Now and then, it seems that life is just too much

When friends are gone, I know my savior's love is real
You know it's real

Any day now you'll close the door, and walk away
I'll be picking through the pieces and wondering how it came to this
If things don't go the way you want it
Well that's the way it goes

These photographs remind me
Of all the things I said
And the promises I made you
On the day that we first met
But ain't that just like you baby
Ain't that just like you
Ain't that like you

Used to be your sun in my sky
It's all over and the days go by
Used to be your sun in my sky
It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go

I wonder if you know just what you're doin' to me
Knowing what we've been through before, what am I say
You've been acting strangely lately, so far away yet you're next to me
When things are not the way they should be
Gotta know when to let it go

These photographs remind me
Of all the things I said
And the promises I made you
On the day that we first met
But ain't that just like you baby
Ain't that just like you
Ain't that like you

Used to be your sun in my sky
It's all over and the days go by
Used to be your sun in my sky
It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go

You been doing me wrong
But I'd have you back if it were mine to choose
You been doing me wrong
But I'd still have you back if it were mine to choose
Used to be your sun in my sky
It's all over and the days go by
Used to be your sun in my sky
It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go

Used to be your sun in my sky
Till the clouds came over and the night set in
Used to be your sun in my sky
It ain't been easy to slowly watch you go, oh no"

On a problem that you have invented

And beats ink in these pages
Letters written in regret
To many lifeless faces
This is the end of me
I am running on empty

Hours spent pouring over these words
With nothing gained
All that was lost with nothing learned
I'm just feeling drained

This is taking so much out of me
I am doubting my place as of late

I wish I could make this paper heart come alive
All my time spent on writing this living lie

This is taking so much out of me

I will bless You Lord because You've been so good
You have been my strength in the time of weakness
Theres never been a time I couldn't count on You
So I will bless You, oh, Lord, in the midst of the people

Come on somebody, right here, right now
We come to give Your name the glory
Somebody help me
Sisters tell me something, come on

Looked around the week was gone
Worked my fingers to the bone, I should've known
That the struggle I had faced wasn't over
Drama won't leave me alone

When the world all around me gives me every reason to faint
My first and the last real defense is to stand and say

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Join in together like this, like this come
Sister tell me something else

Turned around I'd made it through
Wasn't sure of how I would surely fade but You'd cover
And my joy you would renew

You know the enemy seeks and he roars with his plans to abuse
In the midst of his rage and his lies let us stand on the truth

No matter what is going on
My God still sits upon the throne
I might get down but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

No matter what the circumstance
I know my life is n his hands
The storms may come but not for long
My praise will keep me moving on

Now if I'm really honest I really gotta say
That I get somewhat discouraged when trials come my way
But this will be my choice, will be my choice
No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether up or down, whether good or bad
Keep your praise always

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether this or that just don't hold back
Keep your praise flowing

Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on praisin'

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether up or down, whether good or bad
Keep your praise always

No matter what the day may bring to you
Keep praising God
Whether this or that just don't hold back
Keep your praise flowing

Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on praisin'

Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep on, keep praisin'
Keep your praise always
Somebody put your hands together
When it seems like your world is going crazy
This is what you do
Get your praise, keep your praise, keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin'
Keep on praisin'
Keep on praisin'
Keep on praisin'

Keep on praisin'
Keep on praisin'
Keep your praise always

Put your hands let me hear the horns play
When the world all around you is sinking sand
Somebody lift your hands and say

That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto

Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto

Wonder when I'll find paradise
Somewhere there's a home sweet and nice
Wonder if I'll find happiness
Never give it up now I guess

Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto

There's someone coming over the hill someday

Through bullet holes everything is clear
I call your name
When I sleep I'm seeing your face

I gotta get home tonight
If it's the last thing I ever do in my life
I've gotta get home tonight

Time after time, over again
The boys on the front line, they turn into men

Tu de mi
Olvida que un día me viste

Ya lo ves
Los dos nos equivocamos
Y es mejor
Que otros caminos sigamos

Y que esta despedida
Sea por el bien de todos
Inventare algún modo
Para vivir sin ti

Te juro que nadie mas
Te amara como yo
Mas hoy, por ti mi pecho arde
Porque me duele decirte que
A ti he llegado tarde

Aunque no te vuelva a ver
Quiero que sepas que haré
Por ti, mi viaje sin boleto
Y en la distancia siempre seras
Mi eterno amor secreto

Porque entre nosotros
No hay distancia, ni tiempo, ni espacio
Sera siempre eterno nuestro amor"

Pudiste haberme dicho que no
Que no sentías nada por mí
Que lo nuestro nunca fue algo especial
La vida cambia y todo tiene final

Una aventura fui para ti
Y fácilmente yo en tus redes caí
Un trago amargo que de tí recibí
Ahora no sé, no sé qué será de mí

Gotas de lluvia, no es el rocío

Quisiera saber, saber porqué se escapó
De mis brazos toda la felicidad
A toda máquina corriendo voló
No dejó huella, se desapareció

No le importó que yo sintiera temor
De verme solo así llorando de amor
Y por su mente pienso que no pasó
Que por su culpa yo sintiera dolor

Sin una explicación, ey, ey, ey, eh
Mucho te quise, tal vez el mundo me quedó al revés

And if you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Nobody told me you were cheating
Aw it's just a feeling I had
So if I'm right, you got to lie to me
Then I won't feel so bad

Because the truth would only hurt me
And that price is too big to pay
So lie to me, lie to me, I'd rather have it that way

Now you may think I'm foolish for saying what I said

That we try and make each other sad
I don't know why
The things we do
How we make each other feel so bad

Once forgotten soldiers come to life
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done
Not content with wars we never won

Satisfy the scorn
Rise ghosts of war

Target assassinate, time of your life has expired
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie

Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Rise ghosts of war

All life I drain
I dominate
I seal your fate

I deal in pain
All life I drain

ML1196,Bad Religion,The Biggest Killer In American History,"[Verse 1]
You have got your stranglers and prowlers in soft shoes
Furniture makers and carpenters, too
Bombers and commandos, all with some lost cause
Disgruntled workers, immersed in veritás

[Pre-Chorus]
But stealthily, in the land of the free
It's lurking right there, most are unaware of

[Chorus]
The biggest killer in American history
The biggest killer in American history
The biggest killer in American history
The biggest killer in American history
And God shed his grace on thee

[Verse 2]
Business institutions, universities
Both are quite the circus when the killer wants his way
I think of Edward Teller and his moribund reprise
Then I look to Nevada and I can't believe my eyes
It's time for him to die!

[Verse 3]
Most cannot remember minutia learned in school
It's not there on the blackboard, it's what they don't tell you
We have got a problem, it starts and ends right here
It can be defeated but you've got to face your fear

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll join and unite and steady our sight
Then we'll put it right cause it's time to fight

I'm cutting out your picture from page one
I'm gonna get a jacket just like yours
An' give my false support to your cause
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it
Alright

Okay
So let's agree
About the price
And make it one jet airliner
For ten prisoners

Boats an' tanks and planes, it's your game
Kings an' queens an' generals learn your name
I see all the innocents, the human sacrifice
And if death comes so cheap, then the same goes for life"

The way I felt, girl, I knew
That you and me, we were meant to be
In this world full of love, you were made for me

Oh, oh, fantasy girl
You're my fantasy girl
I need you tonight

The way you look, the way you smile
You made me feel like a brand new guy inside
I want you in my fantasy
'Cause I'd do anything for you, don't you see?
The way I feel is oh-so true
I can't deny what I'm telling you
Baby girl, in my fantasy
You would be more than happy, you would be with me

Is that I love you in almost every way
You are the one I've been searching for
In my life, seems to me you are my fantasy
Oh, sweet love, won't you be mine?
I'll treat you like no other man has tried
I'll be your man, never let you down
And I'll always be true not to make you go

With blood on our knives

Guts on your blouse
You’re worth your own weight

In diamonds, a dozen
Sailing to nowhere
Vapor to float on
Still we roll on through the night

Battle systems, trading in lies
Taken down by the hounds, one by one
Longing to find our way out
Following the ghost down

Running in circles, a mouse on the table
I try to feel but just don’t
Curling and dead inside
“Go on and cut him in half”, said I"

ML1222,Palomo,Nos Falto,"Era sexo perfecto lo que habia en nuestra cama
No dejamos jamas ni un pedazo de piel sin calor
El saciar nuestras ganas era lo que importaba
Complacer los sentidos hasta perder la razon

El peor de los silencios se metio entre nosotros
Y no existe ni el menor interes de decir la verdad
Besos de la costumbre y el temor de estar solos
Consumido el deseo nada nos queda ya
Nada nos queda ya...

Nos falto en cada beso entregarnos el alma
Compartir sentimientos no solo una cama
Pensamos que el tiempo mejorara las ganas
Y que el deseo por el cuerpo se volviera la nada

Nos falto acariciarnos con tiernas palabras
Sin quitarnos la ropa sin tocarnos la piel
Fue sexo perfecto lo que hubo en la cama
Pero eso no basta... y nos toca perder

El peor de los silencios se metio entre nosotros
Y no existe ni el menor interes de decir la verdad
Besos de la costumbre y el temor de estar solos
Consumido el deseo nada nos queda ya
Nada nos queda ya...

Nos falto en cada beso entregarnos el alma
Compartir sentimientos no solo una cama
Pensamos que el tiempo mejorara las ganas
Y que el deseo por el cuerpo se volviera la nada

Nos falto acariciarnos con tiernas palabras
Sin quitarnos la ropa sin tocarnos la piel
Fue sexo perfecto lo que hubo en la cama
Pero eso no basta... y hoy nos toca perder..."
ML1223,Dokken,Into The Fire,"[Verse 1]
You weave your spell
Your eyes they beckon me
Your lips they speak, lies and misery
I know it's wrong, but I can't turn away
The flames draw near, they're telling me to stay

Your love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear, you won't be back no more
When will it end, your love consumes my soul
Into the fire, I'm being tempted once more

Words to ease all mortal fear
Lift the souls off on the German front
Counting cadavers on the lost

Soldiers of hate, Nazi leaders and civilians
I will take them to where they belong
For I've seen many wars
Heard a hundred calls to arms
Salvation is my name, alarm!

Pure hate is in the air that I breath
Pure hate
A sickness that's known as pure hate
Abnormal cruelty brings no victory to this war
Pure hate, the wise saw it coming
Pure hate, the mighty paved the path
Pure hate
My kiss of death comes as a blessing not a curse

The curse lives on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on

War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War, war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I heard them banging
On hearts and fingers

People fill the world
With narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
A man with no defense
What's mine's my own
I won't give it to you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do

Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

In the search for something new

I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go
I'm everything you need me to be

[Verse 2]
Your parents say everything is your fault
But they don't know you like I know you they don't know you at all

It's just a phase, you'll be o.k. you're fine
But I know it's a lie

Look me in the eyes so I know you know

ML1243,Alejandro Sanz,Cuando Nadie Me Ve,"[Letra de ""Cuando Nadie Me Ve""]

[Estrofa 1]
A veces me elevo, doy mil volteretas
A veces me encierro tras puertas abiertas
A veces te cuento por qué este silencio
Y es que a veces soy tuyo y a veces del viento
A veces de un hilo y a veces de un ciento
Y hay veces, mi vida, te juro que pienso
Por qué es tan difícil sentir como siento
Sentir, cómo siento que sea difícil

[Estrofa 2]
A veces te miro y a veces te dejas
Me prestas tus alas, revisas tus huellas
A veces por todo aunque nunca me falles
A veces soy tuyo y a veces de nadie
A veces te juro de veras que siento no darte la vida entera
Darte sólo esos momentos
¿Por qué es tan difícil vivir? sólo es eso
Vivir, sólo es eso... ¿Por qué es tan difícil?

[Estribillo]
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve, pongo el mundo al revés
Cuando nadie me ve, no me limita la piel
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve...

[Pos-estribillo]
A veces me elevo, doy mil volteretas
A veces me encierro tras puertas abiertas
A veces te cuento por qué este silencio
Y es que a veces soy tuyo y a veces del viento

[Estrofa 2]
Te escribo desde los centros de mi propia existencia
Donde nacen las ansias, la infinita esencia
Hay cosas muy tuyas que yo no comprendo
Y hay cosas tan mías, pero es que yo no las veo
Supongo que pienso que yo no las tengo
No entiendo mi vida, se encienden los versos
Que a oscuras te puedo, lo siento no acierto
No enciendas las luces que tengo desnudos el alma y el cuerpo

[Estribillo]
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve, me parezco a tu piel
Cuando nadie me ve, no pienso en ella también
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve, no me limita la piel

[Puente]
Cuando nadie me ve, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve, no me limita la piel
Puedo ser, puedo ser o no ser
Cuando nadie me ve

[Final]
A veces me elevo, doy mil volteretas
Te encierro en mis ojos tras puertas abiertas
A veces te cuento por qué este silencio
Y es que a veces soy tuyo y a veces... del viento
A veces del viento
¡Y a veces del tiempo!"
ML1244,Elvis Costello,I Lost You,"[Chorus]
I lost you, I lost you
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in this haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me
And there's nothing I can do because I lost you

[Verse 1]
Just like a rich man who is careless of his change
I took you for granted and then you went to strangers
Deep within my heart, I feel a distant fading pulse
A poor woman looking for the last coin in her purse

[Chorus]
I lost you, I lost you
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in this haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me
And there's nothing I can do because I lost you

[Verse 2]
Just like a counterfeit you pass from palm to palm
I chased the one I surely loved to someone else's arms
I mislaid my senses, now that's easy to say
A fool who took his pleasure and then threw his love away

[Chorus]
I lost you, I lost you
You slipped from your costume
Like an actress in this tragedy
You're just an apparition in this haunting mystery
I fear that you've passed over me
And there's nothing I can do because I lost you

I lost you
I lost you"
ML1245,The Replacements,Skyway,"[Verse 1]
You take the skyway
High above the busy little one-way
In my stupid hat and gloves
At night, I lie awake wonderin' if I'll sleep
Wonderin' if we'll meet out in the street

[Verse 2]
But you take the skyway
It don't move at all like a subway
It's got bums when it's cold
Like any other place, it's warm up inside
Sittin' down and waitin' for a ride
Beneath the skyway

[Interlude]
Mmm-mmm, mmm
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm

[Verse 3]
Oh, then one day
I saw you walkin' down that little one-way
Where the place I'd catch my ride most everyday
There wasn't a damn thing I could do or say
Up in the skyway

The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

[Verse 1]
I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

[Verse 2]
The Argentines collapse in defeat
The admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet
The ground beneath their feet is a nautically mapped sheet
As thin as paper while it slips away from view"
ML1247,Grant-Lee Phillips,It Ain't The Same Old Cold War Harry,"It ain’t the same old cold war Harry
It ain’t the one you know
The sound of all that saber rattling
Makes the blood run cold

It ain’t the same old cold war Harry
It ain’t the one you know
It isn’t black or white Mayberry
The whole place could blow

I got a little girl a cutting teeth
A pretty wife who’s in the bed
Rather be makin’ love or makin’ peace
Don’t wanna live a life of dread

It ain’t the same old cold war Harry
Don’t need a doomsday clock
To be alarmed by all the stars you’re wearing
The funny way you talk

It ain’t the same old cold war Harry
No puttin’ up your dukes
That kinda talk is gettin’ all too scary
You better nix your nukes

It ain’t the same old cold war Harry
It ain’t the one you know
But could ya not stand by that button
The whole place could blow

I got a little girl a cutting teeth
A pretty wife who’s in the bed
Rather be makin’ love or makin’ peace
Don’t wanna live a life of dread

It ain’t the same old cold war Harry
It ain’t the same old war
It ain’t the same old cold war Harry"

But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!

You took hold of my affections
With your Bible and your sword
Your celebrity connections
I was not used to keeping score
From your fine guilded chalice
I drank all your cheap red wine
It was a good place to be Judas (Judas)
Hiding pearls from the swine

[Chorus]
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I come

I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I come

[Verse 2]
You won me just as I failed you
Fist full of cake, who could refuse
All of my love got stuck in traffic (Traffic)
Two thousand miles away from you
Bleeding on into the telephone
On a reupholstered bed of nails
I'm a long, long way from home
I hope my jet lagged heart don't fail

[Chorus]
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I come
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun
I'll bring the sun, I'll bring the sun to you when I come"

You say you don't love me

How can there be wrong
When by committee they choose it all
They choose it all
To turn, to turn

You're gonna grow old
You're gonna grow cold
Bearing signs on the avenue
For your own personal Waterloo
You're bearing signs on the avenue
For your own personal Waterloo, now

We'll fight, we'll fight
We'll fight for your music halls
And dying cities
They'll fight, they'll fight
They'll fight for your neural walls
And plasticities
And precious territory

[Verse 2]
This isn't our song
This isn't even a musical
I think life is too long
To be a whale in a cubicle
Nails under your cuticle
To turn, to turn

Gonna grow old
You're gonna grow so cold
Before this song can deliver you
You're bearing signs on the avenue
You're bearing signs
For your own personal Waterloo now

ML1254,Lori McKenna,Pour,"In the depths of the deep blue sea
There's a blue as blue as me
Where a quiet symphony plays for the lonely

I could just let it all go
Sink down to the world below
Where I don't breathe but I don't know
Cause I'm breathless

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour
Pour

I don't where my lover went
But I know that he took the rent
And I know that he went and spent all my loving

And I'm not rich, but I don't care
I'll find that boy anywhere
I'll walk the land, fly the air, and tread water

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour
Pour

If the moon could sing a song
With the symphony in the blue beyond
They'd tell me he was really gone forever

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour

When it's love
It will rain sometimes
When it's love, it will pour
Pour, pour, pour

It will pour
It will pour
It will pour"

En aplastar mi ambición, tú sigue así, ya verás
Miro el reloj, es mucho más tarde que ayer
Te esperaría otra vez y no lo haré, no lo haré

Vete de aquí, no me supiste entender
Yo solo pienso en tu bien, no es necesario mentir
Qué fácil es atormentarse después
Pero sobreviviré, sé que podré, sobreviviré

ML1257,The Chi-Lites,Toby,"Oh, oh, oh
I remember when we were kids
We shared all the hurt and tears

No matter what the weather
(What the weather

What the weather)
We were always together

Then we grew up
And time went on
We became separated

When I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited
I went off to school
My sweet Toby waited

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
Was a sad day
When Toby went away

Sad day
Toby went away
Sad day
Toby went away

I came home from spring vacation
Expected to find my Toby waiting
Called her on her private phone
She didn't answer
Something was wrong

I ran all the way to her house
Rang her bell
Her mother answered and told me
To come and sit a spell

I sat down to try to be prepared
For what she'd say
And what she said
Brought tears to my eyes
I couldn't push away

Toby left on a cloudy, rainy day
She went to sing with the angels
Toby's gone away

It was a sad day
Oh, oh, Toby went away
It was a sad day
When Toby went away

It was a sad day
Oh, oh, when Toby went away
It was a sad day
When Toby went away

Was a sad day
When Toby went away
Was a sad, sad day
When Toby went away"

ML1259,Frank Sinatra,It Gets Lonely Early,"When you're all alone
All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Ev'ry single endless day

When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Still the old heart's young enough to say

""It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?
""Truly lovely, wasn't it?""
Strings
Ev'ry single lovely day"
ML1260,John Pizzarelli,Mountain Greenery,"On the first of May, it is moving day
Spring is here, so blow your job
Throw your job away

Now's the time to trust to your wanderlust
In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
Just you wait

In our mountain greenery
Where God paints the scenery
Just two crazy people together

While you love your lover
Let blue skies be your coverlet
When it rains, we'll laugh at the weather

And if you're good
I'll search for wood
So you can cook while I stand looking

Beans could get no keener
Reception in a beanery
Bless our mountain greenery home

Mosquitoes here
Won't bite you dear
Well, I'll let them sting me on the finger

We could find no cleaner retreat
From life's machinery
Bless our mountain greenery home
Our mountain greenery home"

This manger for Your bed
You have a long road before You
Rest Your little head

Can you feel the weight of Your glory
Do You understand the price
Or does the Father guard Your heart for now
So You can sleep tonight

Go to sleep my son
Go and chase Your dreams
This world can wait for one more moment
Go and sleep in peace

I believe the glory of heaven
Is lying in my arms tonight
But Lord I ask that He for just this moment
Simply be my child

Go to sleep my son

Soon enough You'll save the day
But for now dear child of mine
Oh my Jesus sleep tight"
ML1266,Third Day,Merry Christmas,"There's a little girl trembling on a cold December morn
Crying for mama's arms
At an orphanage just outside a little China town
Where the forgotten are

But half a world away I hang the stockings by the fire
And dream about the day when I can finally call you mine

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

As I hang the tinsel on the tree and watch the twinkling lights
I'm warmed by the fire's glow
Outside the children tumble in the wonderland of white
And make angels in the snow

But half a world away you try your best to fight the tears
And hope that Heaven's Angels come to carry you here

It's Christmas time again but you're not home
Your family is here and yet you're somewhere else alone
So tonight I pray that God will come and hold you in His arms
And tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

Christmas is the time we celebrate the Holy Child
And we celebrate His perfect gift of love
He came to Earth to give His life and prepare a place for us
So we could have a home with Him above

It's Christmas time again and now you're home
Your family is here so you will never be alone
So tonight before you go to sleep, I'll hold you in my arms
And tell you from my heart
I'll tell you from my heart
I wish you Merry Christmas

And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky

I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' ""How do you do?""
They're really saying ""I love you""

I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know

We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart

[Verse 2]
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes

How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath

And it broke me in two

I'm in love with love
Look out baby, it's gonna break you too

I'd pull your ship across the ocean wide
Hold my breath
And dive dive dive
If they held me at the bottom
Then asked me why
I'd open my mouth and I'd tell em why 'cause

I'm in love with love

And it broke me in two

We're saying our prayers
Two lovers in the mist
With the salt in their hair

I'm in love I'm in love

And it broke me in two
I'm in love I'm in love
It's gonna break you too
Yes it will

The waves are breaking in a foreign tongue
Understand but I'm feeling numb
If your love was a ship
I'd pull your anchor and hang on to it

I'm in love with love

And it broke me in two

The truth is fading away
Will I ever get through?

No matter the pain
No matter if it's in vain (if it's in vain)
No matter the pain
No matter if you get insane
No matter if you get insane

You feel so fucking down
Don't you feel alive
You feel so fucking down
Don't you feel alive

You're just a time bomb
No matter if you're right or wrong
This is just your damn song
No matter if you're right or fucking wrong

No matter the pain
No matter if it's in vain (if it's in vain)
No matter the pain
No matter if you get insane

Can't find the answers
I've been crawlin' on my knees
Lookin' for anything
To keep me from drowning

Promises have been turned to lies
Can't even be honest inside
Now I'm runnin' backwards
Watchin' my life wave me goodbye

I'm runnin' blind
I'm runnin' blind
Somebody help me see
I'm runnin' blind

Searchin' for nothing
Wonderin' if I'll change
I'm tryin' everything
But everything still stays the same

I thought if I showed you I could fly
Wouldn't need anyone by my side
I'm goin' backwards
With broken wings I know I'll die

ML1275,Eva Cassidy,Time After Time,"[Verse 1]
Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick, and think of you
Turning in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback to warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after—

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you have said
And you say, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time

[Verse 3]
After your picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
I'm wondering if you're okay
And you say, ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The drum beats out of time

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

She knows how to make sunshine out of the rain
A woman in love
Knows exactly how to kiss away the pain

A woman in love is more precious than gold
A woman in love is the truth untold

A woman in love seems to carry
The whole world in her arms

Quiero verte sonreír de nuevo
Pero, ya verás, que este es el principio y no el final

No quiero dejar mi espacio ni mi esencia un día más
No voy a dejar de amar ni voy dejar de respirar
Me quiero quedar contigo hasta el final, hasta el final

ML1281,Joy Division,Heart And Soul,"[Verse 1]
Instincts that can still betray us
A journey that leads to the sun
Soulless and bent on destruction
A struggle between right and wrong
You take my place in the showdown
I'll observe with a pitiful eye
I'll humbly ask for forgiveness
A request well beyond you and I

[Chorus]
Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

[Verse 2]
An abyss that laughs at creation
A circus complete with all fools
Foundations that lasted the ages
Then ripped apart at their roots
Beyond all this good is the terror
The grip of a mercenary hand
When savagery turns all good reason
There's no turning back, no last stand

[Chorus]
Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

Existence, well, what does it matter?
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future

In the hills, there is trouble

Casualties increase as the enemy shell
The climate's unhealthy, flies and rats thrive
And sooner or later the end will arrive

Gunfire's increasing, looting, burning, rape!

And if we go out tonight
Would there be blood on your shoe
And would it taste like better shit?
'Cause I don't know

Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give back pain
Show me how you throw, throw him down

There were times in the past
If I had the nerve, I couldn't make it last
Courage wasted in the night
And is it really so hard?
Tell your body to forget the words
Pushing you to run
'Cause I don't know

Can you teach me how to fight?
Show me what it's like to give back pain
Show me how you throw, throw him down"

If you really love him then tell me that you love him again, and go

If you really love him, tell me that you love him again
If you really love him, tell me that you love him again

I let go of your hand as you suggest I go
And with that I was gone
And after all that was said
Was it meaningless
When you danced with me
To ""Walkin' in the Sand""?
And I'd like you to know
That my love is love that you can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again

There's nothing to do here
Some just whine and complain
In bed at the hospital
Coming and going
Asleep and awake
In bed at the hospital

Tell me the story of how you ended up here
I've heard it all in the hospital
Nurses are fussin'
Doctors on tour
Somewhere in India

I got one friend laying across from me
I did not choose him, he did not choose me
We've got no chance of recovery
Sharing hospital joy and misery
The joy and misery
The joy and misery

Put out the fire boys, don't stop, don't stop
Put out the fire on us
Put out the fire boys, don't stop, don't stop
Put out the fire on us
Bring your buckets by the dozens
Bring your nieces and your cousins
Come put out the fire on us

See my knees, how they quiver
My whole body's in a jitter
I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown

I went to see the doctor just the other day
I got to tell you what he had to say
Well, he said, ""Hey, boy, you just gotta slow down
You can't keep a-traipsin' all over town
After givin' you a physical check
I've come to the conclusion you're a total wreck""

I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown
A mental shakedown
See my hands, how they shiver
See my knees, how they quiver
My whole body's in a jitter
I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown

I've made up my mind, I'd better change my ways
My shattered nerves have seen better days
No more guys for a week or two
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew
No more movies or stayin' out late
My baby's got to find himself another date

I'm a-havin' a nervous breakdown
A mental shakedown
I'm havin' a nervous breakdown
I'm havin' a nervous breakdown
I'm havin' a nervous breakdown

Hey you
The longtime stranger
Do you think of before?
When we were wrapped up in ourselves
In a mess behind the door
Now it seems so, so immature
Your stolen signs
The stickers on your door

The beginning was warmer
Than your ending prose
You were another conqueror
I was another part disposed
I guess that's just the way it goes

[Verse 2]
Hey you
My one time wonderer
Do you feel for before?
It is etched out in photographs
And scratched up records
Now it seems so, so immature
Your postered walls
The dirt on your floor

The beginning was warmer
Than your ending prose
You were another conqueror
I was another part disposed

[Bridge]
So I want to know
Did you ever think of me on a summer's day?
Or holding her hand out in the rain?
Remember I said 'Please, please, please don't go'
And now we're just strangers in different worlds

When I hustle, baby I be thinking of you
I'm always on the grind

When I'm out on my hustle (hustle, hustle)
I'm coming home to you
Shawty I'm coming home to you

Yeah, I'mma hustler, but baby girl I wanna fuck wit ya
You the type to make a thug nigga turn in love wit ya
Mami let me tell you, I ain't nothing like these other scrubs
It's H-u-e-y, cowboy, he fly
Got money to the skizzy, thats why I fly G-5
If any brother could tell you he do you better he lie
No, I ain't Nelly, but could make you holler +E.I.+
When we f-u-c-k-i-n-g in the treetop
Bet you will feel special than ever when we ride

Or make me feel that I ain't as thug as I seem
When we make love, have me weak at the knees
The only female that could do what she please
But say it ain't trickin when I'm giving her g’s
Care whether I'm hurt or safe in the streets
I’ll tell you mami don’t worry, I'm safe with the heat
Now come a lil closer, move your waist to the beat
In the winter I'm the comfort for heat when you sleep
There's no other couple that’s fucking with we
The more I'm around, gratify me to love you
There's one thing to know and that's

ML1316,Elefante,El Abandonao,"Anoche pude ver cuando te fuiste
Solito me quede y no dije nada
Tal vez esta cancion te suene triste
Pero me esta llevando la Chingada

Y lo que me digas de memoria me lo se
Tus mentiras no me serviran de nada
Te lo perdiste ojala te vaya bien
Yo me voy por donde vine
Se que no me perdere

Abandonao un exiliado
De tu boca, de tus manos, de tu corazon
Sin rumbo fijo voy de la mano
De mis sueños vagabundos
Y me importa poco que me diga el mundo
El abandonao

El tiempo es el doctor de los dolidos
Para sanar las penas que te embriagan
Yo siempre me las curo con tequila
Oyendo a Jose Alfredo y al Sabina
Y no pasa nada se que no me morire
Como dice la cancion asi es la vida
Mirame a los ojos aunque sea la ultima vez
Solo vine a despedirme no te vine a detener

Abandonao un exiliado
De tu boca, de tus manos, de tu corazon
Sin rumbo fijo voy de la mano
De mis sueños vagabundos
Y me importa poco que me diga el mundo
El abandonao

Asi estoy yo sin ti
Fallaste corazon
Ya lo pasado, pasado
Te doy una cancion
De que manera te olvido
Esta tarde vi llover
Besame besame mucho
Toquenme la que se fue

Abandonao un exiliado
De tu boca, de tus manos, de tu corazon
Sin rumbo fijo voy de la mano
De mis sueños vagabundos
Y me importa poco que me diga el mundo
El abandonao"

Love lifted me, love lifted me

You were just takin' care of your self
You were never mine
So kiss my love goodbye

Don't tell me that your heart is breakin'
Cause this time baby I ain't takin'

Don't mess up that pretty face
Can't you see it's just too late
This time baby you went too far
I see you now for what you are

Kiss my love goodbye
I've had it with your lyin'
Kiss my love goodbye
You weren't even tryin'
You never thought about anyone else
You were just takin' care of your self
You were never mine
So kiss my love goodbye"
ML1319,James Ingram,I Don't Have The Heart,"[Verse 1]
Your face is beaming
You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way you want me to

[Verse 2]
Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand?
I care about you
So much about you, baby!
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way you want me to

[Bridge]
You're so trusting
And open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart
Oh, no!
I don't have the heart

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart
To hurt you
It's the last thing I wanna do
But I don't have the heart
To love you
Not the way that you want me to

[Outro]
I don't have the heart
Ooh!
Baby, I don't have the heart!
I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart
Ooh! Ooh!

I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart
I don't have the heart"

Witness the answer to my prayer
And like a bolt of lightning

My heart is singing a joyful melody
I never had a love so rare
So whenever you go I will be there

Now that I have you here with me

ML1331,Marsha Ambrosius,Lose Myself,"I can love you better
Lose myself in love ..

I used to do it for the love a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
I used to love without fear a long time ago
And all i ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Try to make me feel like i was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me no!

I had to lose myself so i could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better, lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is?

Couldn?t tell me i was in love when i needed it
When, all i ever wanted was love
Should a told me i was worth receiving it
But all i ever wanted was love
There?s something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see!

I had to lose myself so i could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So i could love you better
Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is?

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And i couldn?t love you perfectly with that fear in my head
So i perilously had to face the danger
So i could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul i said!
So i could make it better

I had to lose myself had to lose myself
So i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Make it better

Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is

And so it goes that i never meant to hurt you
Couldn?t stay but i never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things i just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot of years i suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years i can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind!

I had to lose myself so i could love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself so i could
Love you better baby better baby
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So i could love you better baby
Had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love
Yeah, so I can love you better baby lose myself in love
Lose myself in love
And that?s just the way it is!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did
Great love to absorb all the misuse i did
Hey baby it?s not an excuse i give
And i?d do it all again because for you i live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse i did
Great love to absorb all the misuse i did
Hey baby it?s not an excuse i give
And i?d do it all again because for you i live

Had to lose myself so i could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love, so I could love you better baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So I could love you better baby baby
Had to lose myself in love again
So i could love you better baby baby baby
I can love you better baby, i could love you better , i could love you better
I can love you better I could love you better I could love you better
It sure feels right
That?s just the way it is"

Every time I hear your song
I can't believe you're everything I need
Mama, you can do no wrong

I wish I knew everything it takes to get along
Then we could take it easy
Or we will both be sorry
Then we could take it easy, take it easy
Or we both be sorry
Let's take it easy

Sometimes I think about what I would do without
Who knew we could be such friends?
Dreaming of your love and warming touch
When can I see you again?

Up all night I shiver with delight
Every time I hear your song
Dizzy with anticipation
How's everything coming along?

I wish I could do whatever it takes to get along
Then we should take it easy
Or we will both be sorry
Then we should take it easy, take it easy
Or we will both be sorry

I'm taking the cure so I can be quiet wherever I want
So leave me alone
You ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks

Korkuyorsam, bir nedeni var elbet
Ateş yaktığı yerde dert

Beni ellere verdin utanmadan hiç

[Verso 1]
Otra vez jugando con mi amor diciendo que ya no me necesitas
Por qué un día te me das y al otro te me quitas
Otra vez volviendo a repetir que todo fue un error, una diablura
Por qué un día huyes de mí y al siguiente me buscas

[Coro]
Tú me estás volviendo loco corazón
Tú me estás haciendo malo porque sí
Tú me estás rompiendo el alma
Y es que ya no tengo calma
Ni contigo, ni sin ti

Tú me estás volviendo loco corazón
Tú me estás robando ganas de vivir
Y no hay modo de curarme
Porque no puedo quedarme
Ni contigo ni sin ti

[Verso 2]
Otra vez hablándome de él diciendo que es aquél a quien tú amas
Por qué un día me traicionas y al siguiente me llamas
Otra vez diciendo que te irás y que nunca jamás veré tu cara
Por qué un día estoy de más y al siguiente me extrañas

[Coro]
Tú me estás volviendo loco corazón
Tú me estás haciendo malo porque sí
Tú me estás rompiendo el alma
Y es que ya no tengo calma
Ni contigo, ni sin ti

Tú me estás volviendo loco corazón

ML1349,Ricky Martin,Con Tu Nombre,"Dejo abierta la ventana por si llega una canción
Y una red de mariposas colgando en el balcón
Por si el viento deja alguna historia ahí enredada
Y notas olvidadas sin rasgos de tu ausencia

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo
Tengo que olvidarme de tus labios
Antes, tengo que arrancar de mi memoria
Cada beso que empezaba con tu nombre

Quedaran algunas letras en errante melodía
Un puñado de palabras a medio terminar
Cuando el tiempo deje este camino abandonado
Sin llegar a ningún lado y desnudo de tus huellas

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo
Tengo que olvidarme de tus besos
Antes tengo que arrancar de mi memoria
Cada beso que empezaba con tu nombre

Esta es la última vez
Que canto tu nombre
Tu nombre

Esta es la última vez

Antes, antes de soñar de nuevo
Tengo que olvidarme de tus labios
Antes, antes de cerrar mis ojos
Tengo que olvidarme de tu piel
Antes tengo que arrancar de mi memoria
Cada beso que empezaba con tu nombre"

ML1370,Death Cab For Cutie,Someday You Will Be Loved,"[Verse 1]
I once knew a girl in the years of my youth
With eyes like the summer, all beauty and truth
But in the morning I fled, left a note and it read:
""Someday you will be loved""

[Verse 2]
I cannot pretend that I felt any regret
'Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
And as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

[Chorus]
You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
'Cause someday you will be loved

[Verse 3]
You may feel alone when you're falling asleep
And every time tears roll down your cheeks
But I know your heart belongs to someone you've yet to meet
And someday you will be loved

[Chorus]
You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
But someday you will be loved

[Chorus]
You'll be loved, you'll be loved, like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs, like I never occurred
And someday you will be loved
And someday you will be loved"
ML1371,Daryle Singletary,Amen Kind Of Love,"Don't guess I've ever loved another
Never once before did I really see the light
'Cause they were barely friends and merely lovers
And it's taken what you've given me to feel like I do tonight

I am moved by the spirit
And I am here to testify

I found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees and reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't never get enough
I found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love

You've given love a brand new meaning
Bound by a higher power than I've ever known before
Safe in your faithful arms I am leaning
Once I was lost but now I'm found forevermore

And I am moved by the spirit
And I am here to testify

I found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees and reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't never get enough
I found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love

We are moved by the spirit
And we are here to testify

We've found an amen kind of love
The kind that makes you fall down on your knees and reach for the sky above
The kind that your soul just can't never get enough
We've found an amen, an amen, an amen kind of love"
ML1372,Lonestar,Tell Her,"[Verse 1]
So you say your love's about to end
You say you can't take no more
She's out the door
And your looking for a friend
Who am I to tell you why?
But I'm just curious, were you furious
Or did you swallow your pride
And look her in the eye and

[Chorus]
Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her

[Verse 2]
Brother I've been right where you are now
And my heart was broke
'Cause I never spoke
Those healing words out loud
But I've learned my lesson well
And now every night
Before I close my eyes
I look at my woman and
I ask myself did you

[Chorus]
Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her

Tell her that you love her

[Chorus]
Tell her that you love her
Tell her that you need her
Tell her that you want her to stay
Reassure her with a kiss
She may never know unless you
Show her what your feeling
Tell her you're believing
Even though it's hard to say
'Cause she needs to know you're thinking of her
So open up and tell her that you love her
Tell her that you love her"

ML1374,Gregory Porter,Lonely One,"Did you pick the wrong one
Did he break your heart
He started acting crazy
When you wanted to part

He left some scars on your face
And bruised your grace with friends
It will be okay
The lonely one is here

Did you pick the wrong one
Confused you with his smile
Tricked you with his letters
And his fancy style

He pushed a ring on you
Before you knew
You're isolated now
It will be okay
The lonely one is here
Oh, the lonely one is here

You're not just meant to wait it out
Be patient until he figures it out
He ought to know the obvious
Girl, that you're, you're so marvelous

He asks some questions of love
That you answered long ago
Does he care for you, I don't know
But I wish you, I wish you let, let it go
It will be okay, the lonely one is here
Oh, the lonely one is here

Did you pick the wrong one
Did you pick the wrong one

ML1375,Sinead O'Connor,War,"[Verse 1]
Until the philosophy
Which holds one race superior
And another inferior
Is finally and permanently
Discredited and abandoned
Everywhere is war

[Verse 2]
Until there is no longer first class
Or second class citizens of any nation
That until the color of a man's skin
Is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
I've got to say ""war""

[Verse 3]
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Then we say ""war""

[Verse 4]
That until that day the dream of lasting peace
World-citizenship and the rule of
International morality will remain
Just a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never obtained
And everywhere is war

[Verse 5]
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
There'll be war
And the rumors of war

[Verse 6]
That until the ignoble and unhappy regime
Which holds our sisters in Africa, yeah
Africa, yeah
Sub-human bondage has been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Everywhere is war

[Verse 7]
And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight - we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
'Cause we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil
Good over evil
Good over evil"

Long distance runner, what you standin there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door

Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

It should all add up, but it doesn't

ML1383,Mike Reno & Ann Wilson,Almost Paradise,"[Verse 1:]
I thought that dreams belonged to other men
Cause each time I got close
They'd fall apart again
I feared my heart would beat in secrecy

I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could I have known
That all my life
I only needed you

[Chorus:]
Oh
Almost paradise
We're knocking on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?

I swear that I can see
Forever in your eyes
Paradise

[Verse 2:]
It seems like perfect
Love's so hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must've read my mind
And all these dreams
I saved for a rainy day
They're finally coming true

I'll share them all with you
Cause now we hold the
Future in our hands

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
And in your arms
Salvation's not so far away
It's getting closer
Closer every day

[Repeat Chorus:]

Paradise

I believe I'll go back home
I believe I'll go back home
Acknowledge that I've done wrong

Father, kind and patient, as kind as he could be
Gave to me my portion that he had promised me
Father told his servants, bring the fatted calf down
Pass it on to my gone child that he best come back home

Well, I believe I'll go back home
I believe I'll go back home
I believe I'll go back home
Acknowledge that I've done wrong

I'm going back to my father, fall down on my knee
Gotta do better than I did, recognize me if you please
My father saw him a-coming, immediately when he cried
""Gonna bring home again now, this is my begotten child""

I believe I'll go back home
I believe I'll go back home
I believe I'll go back home
Acknowledge that I've done wrong

Father, kind and patient, as kind as he could be

Acknowledge that I've done wrong"

I'd move to Rockferry tomorrow
And I'd build my house, baby, with sorrow
I'll leave my shadow to fall behind
And I wouldn't write to you 'cause I'm not that kind

I pick my load and I fill my truck before it's too late
I leave the stars to judge my every move
I'm not going to think of you, or I'll get the blues

There's no sleep on the journey away from town
A bag of songs and a heavy heart won't make me down
I'll give it all my strength and my might
I'll make this decision, win all the fights

And I'll build my house, baby, with sorrow
I'll leave my shadow to fall behind

ML1388,Silversun Pickups,Growing Old Is Getting Old,"[Verse 1]
So we all are growing old
And it's getting old
Pressure on our hollow bones
And the varicose
Suddenly, we decompose
But we're not alone
So we all are growing old

[Chorus]
Maybe we're sealed in silence
And maybe we feel a guidance
Maybe your own devices
Will keep you afraid and cold, but I

Memorized your smile lines
When lips divide
Kept alive your childlike
Reaction time
We're allowed to expire
With ourselves in mind
So we all are growing old

[Chorus]
Put out the fear of silence
And put out the need for guidance
And put out your own devices
And don't be afraid of the cold

We sing, we sing, we sing
We fight, we fight, we fight
Then we cry, we cry, we cry
Then we slide, we slide, we slide into the light

[Bridge]
Do we sing, we fight, we cry?
We slide, we slide, we slide into the light

[Chorus]
Maybe we're sealed in silence
Maybe we feel a guidance
Maybe your own devices

Put out the fear of silence
Put out the need for guidance
Put out your own devices

Afraid of the cold, afraid over time
You've got nowhere to go but here"

Can you believe this world's got the nerve to insist they won't trade for a better one?

Can you believe this world never would have had the chance without us giving it blood?
Can you believe this world lacks the common courtesy to thank us all for the love?

Set it on fire!
Set it on fire!
Set it on fire!

Can you believe this world's like a glassy eyed swiller caught sipping another one?
Can you believe this world's like a tyrant taking over anything that it wants?
Can you believe this world's like a wounded martyr worried if his commitment is gone?
Can you believe this world's like a vagrant in the gutter talking nothing is wrong?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Can you believe this world's just a double dealing joker, going to stick to his guns?
Can you believe this world's just a television blaring, a million devils at once?
Can you believe this world's just a charmer in disguise with a lavender soul?
Can you believe this world's just exactly as we built it, running out of control?

Cargo una navaja, Dios mío, para ti
Cuantas veces me mordiste
Y cuantas veces yo me fui
Ya no estoy enamorado con tus mentiras
Pa' el infierno me duermo, porque el infierno es la unica verdad

Drinks down in New Orleans

Never do what I have done
Shun that house in New Orleans

How everybody says I love you
Ain’t it a shame
How a word can't tell you more than words can say
I need you here
Ain’t it strange

I need you here

ML1401,Balkan Beat Box,War Again,"Here we are like we're going to get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Coming over and over again

It's picking up now, getting more like a game
And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But u can always tell your better half
Always tell your better half of the story
It goes well with the better side of your face u show on TV
Give me a good reason why I shouldn't start a revolution
What's in the constitution? Is this illusion that we buy?
You cut the wings and then you say fly
You say the hero is the one that died
But the true hero is the one who doesn't live a lie and understands
That there's an end out of the cycle
Who's the master? Who's the disciple?
You can do what you can, but will you do it again?
So what's the plan?
Looks like we are going to get war again

Here we are like we're going to get war again
Coming hard, come and get a gun, join the gang
With the bang bang and the same song we sang
Coming over and over again

It's picking up now, getting more like a game

And it feels real like we learn to fake the fame
And there's never more then one truth
But you can always tell your better half

Look out
Going to get war again, going to get wrong again
Gone again, with the same song again, on again
Can't be born again, who's gone again?
Who's going to gain out of this war again?
Hooligan in a tie, rule again
Soon again u will see it all begin again
Sink again, and that will make you think again

And when they call you go
When they are wrong you know
And you will fallow, and you will swallow
Again like long ago the bomb will blow
So sit back relax and enjoy the show
Cuz you are as cold as snow and I am here below
I'm going to speak out, scream out
Here we go, got the fresh flow
So before it's over
Then you are going to find a different kind of war to start again

Going to get war again"
ML1402,Death Cab For Cutie,We Laugh Indoors,"[Verse 1]
When we laugh indoors
The blissful tones bounce off the walls and fall to the ground
Peel the hardwood back to let them loose
From decades trapped and listen so still
This city is my home, construction noise all day long
And gutter punks are bumming change
So, I breed thicker skin and let my lustrous coat fill in
And I'll never admit

And I've always fallen fast
With too much trust in the promising
That no one's ever been here
So, you can quell those wet fears
And I want purity
I must have it here right now
But don't you get me started now
Oh, don't you get me started now
Don't you, get me
Don't you, get me

ML1403,The Kills,U.R.A. Fever,"[Verse 1: Jamie Hince, Alison Mosshart]
Walk you to the counter
What you got to offer
Pick you out a soda
Look at you forever
Walk you to the water
Eyes like a casino
You ain't born typical
Find a piece of silver
Pretty as a diagram
Go down to the Rio
Put it in my left hand
Put it in a fruit machine
Everyone's a winner
Laughing like a seagull

[Chorus: both]
You are a fever, you are a fever
You ain't born typical
You are a fever, you are a fever
You ain't born typical

[Verse 2:Jamie Hince, Alison Mosshart & both]
Living in a suitcase
Meet a clown and fall in love
Been dying to have you over
Clown around and break up
Take you to a jukebox
That's the situation
Pick you out a number
That's our arrangement

Dancing on the legs of a new born pony
Left right left right, keep it up son
Go ahead and have her, go ahead and leave her
You only ever had her when you were a fever

[Chorus: both]
I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical
I am a fever, I am a fever
I ain't born typical

We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical
We are a fever, We are a fever
We ain't born typical"

I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely nights

Are you alone? Tell me what's your name?
I just need someone to lean on, I'm not playing any games
So sit down here beside me
And let me buy you a glass of red rose wine

[Refrain]
I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely night

[Bridge]
When I thought that I was strong
But the night can be so long when you need a friend
But maybe we could find a little piece of mind
Before the morning comes again

[Verse 3]
So pardon me, if it seems I'm holdin' on
Letting go, it just isn't easy when your sleeping all alone
So let's forget about tomorrow, beg, steal or borrow
Hmm, just a little time

I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely nights
Yes, I can take the lonely days but I can't take these lonely nights"
ML1405,Toots & The Maytals,True Love Is Hard To Find ,"You say that your love was just for me
And that's why I've got to be yours
You told me the day will never come
When you will walk out on me
'Cause you know that true love is hard to find
Of course you know that true love is hard to find
Just because you know that true love is hard to find
Hard to find
Very hard to find
I say true love, true love, true love, true love
True love is hard to find
You told me that you know I have to travel all over
That you would take care of my business for me
But darling, all I ask of you is to leave those business alone
And say your love endures for me
'Cause I know that true love is hard to find
Of course I know that true love is hard to find
I believe true love is hard to find
Hard to find
Very, very hard to find
I say true love, true love, true love, true love

And know it fills my heart with joy forever and love for you

And always know my heart fills with love for you

I'm really close tonight
And I feel like I'm moving inside her
Lying in the dark
And I think that I'm beginning to know her
Let it go
I'll be there when you call

And whenever I fall at your feet
You let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

[Verse 2]
You're hiding from me now
There's something in the way that you're talking
The words don't sound right
But I hear them all moving inside you
Know
I'll be waiting when you call

[Chorus]
Hey, whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain

The finger of blame has turned upon itself
And I'm more than willing to offer myself
Do you want my presence or need my help?
Who knows where that might lead

Whenever I fall at your feet
Won't you let your tears rain down on me?

Don't look ahead you'll just be misunderstood

Who do you believe? Every story has a twist
Take a look around, tell me what you see
People in the world just trying to be free
What about all those things you could have done but you don't?
They say things happen for a reason, you don't do them, they won't

Everything in between and what happens after
I'm looking for life, lookin for love, lookin for laughter

Things are gunna change, they never stay the same
That's why we're fighting a war but the people are to blame
You can only stand up for what you believe
Don't be blinded by the power of greed
What about all those things you could have done but you don't?
They say things happen for a reason, you don't do them, they won't

The velvet sky, all so bright

Because I see what you see too

All the darkness will burn
Recalling pictures of olden days
All these feelings return
If you're breathing you've been afraid
In the shadows remain
I'll be stalking you night and day
Till you share all my pain

Now we step into the fire

Beware you will pay
Ladykiller
I swear you will pay
Ladykiller

Bait the killer and lie in wait
Till the morning unfolds
Now he's feeding on my mistakes
And the trail has run cold
All the violence that fills the world
Leaving nothing for shame
This is when so much pain will call out
Such things I have learned

Hear my vow and fear my vengeance

Beware you will pay
Ladykiller
I swear you will pay

ML1416,Aventura,La Nina,"[Letra de ""La Niña""]

[Intro]
Something special
¡Aventura!

[Verso 1]
La niña duerme tan profundo
Sólo un fuego o un disparo la puede despertar
Tan inocente, apenas tiene nueve años
Y mañana quizás lo entenderá
Que un extraño en su cama tocó su cuerpecito
Con malicia y sin piedad
Ella no entiende que hay personas en la vida
Que se animan sólo para hacer maldad

[Coro: Henry Santos & Romeo Santos]
¿Y quién diablos fue?
Un desgraciado sin corazón
Dígame cómo entró
Quizás olvidaron cerrar la puerta
Sólo saben que hizo el daño y se marchó

[Verso 2: Romeo Santos]
El día siguiente un oficial
Preguntaba a sus padres cómo fue que sucedió
La madre sufre y el padre pensativo
No habían huellas de aquel que la violó
La niña llora, se imagina que ayer mientras dormía
Algo malo le pasó
Más ve el sangrero en su ropa
Policías en su cuarto y un poquito de dolor

[Coro: Henry Santos & Romeo Santos]
¿Y quién diablos fue?
Un desgraciado sin corazón
Dígame cómo entró
Quizás olvidaron cerrar la puerta
Sólo saben que hizo el daño y se marchó

[Refrán: Romeo Santos]
¿Cómo es posible que alguien pueda hacer daño a un angelito de Dios?
La niña solo tenía nueve años y un malva'o la violó
Aquí les traigo otra historia a la gente y esta vez no es de amor
No es un mensaje, es una anécdota triste que hoy convierto en canción

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
This is what you like
It's your favorite group, baby
You know
Alex, your daddy loves you
Llora guitarra, como llora esa niña

[Coro: Henry Santos & Romeo Santos]
¿Y quién diablos fue?
Un desgraciado sin corazón
Dígame cómo entró
Quizás olvidaron cerrar la puerta
Sólo saben que hizo el daño y se marchó

[Refrán: Romeo Santos]
¿Cómo es posible que alguien pueda hacer daño a un angelito de Dios?
La niña solo tenía nueve años y un malva'o la violó
Aquí les traigo otra historia a la gente y esta vez no es de amor
No es un mensaje, es una anécdota triste que hoy convierto en canción

[Verso 3: Romeo Santos]
Pasaron meses y la niña con su trauma se le hace difícil dormir
No se divierte y sus muñeca tienen polvo, ya no juega, nadie la ve reír
Y otra noche de martirio, pesadillas del pasado que la hacen sufrir
Ya son las tres de la mañana y la niña en llanto se duerme por fin

[Coro: Henry Santos & Romeo Santos]
Y volvió
Y el mismo desgraciado sin corazón
¿Pero cómo de nuevo entró?
No se imaginan cómo lo hizo
Nunca hubo una puerta abierta
Y esta vez la niña despertó
""Papi, ¿qué tú hace'?"""

Then the planes hit the towers
Then she died, then he died
A part of me disappeared, six feet in the ground
Million miles in the sky, a fire burns
A fire burns, a fire burns and it is mine

And I did what I did
What we did to survive
Five whole years of my life, I spent mourning you and why?
Girl, you're still alive
You're too dead to keep inside
You take the years, you keep it all
I finally think I might be alright

So let's just let it all go, 'cause nothing can change
And if something is lost, then there's something to frame
I just sing what I have
And I got this girl, not yet crushed by the world
I'll count the freckles on her face one, two, three hundred times a day

And sing a new song
Something I'd never hear
It's better love that I found, bigger love that you fear
So deep inside me, hot in this frozen cave
Her fire burns, her fire burns, her fire burns and it is brave

When I was eighteen, everything was alive
Then the planes hit the towers
Then she died, then he died
A part of me disappeared, six feet in the ground
Million miles in the sky, a fire burns
A fire burns, and I just let it all go

And I won't fear change
And if something is lost, then there is something to frame
I just sing what I have in the heavens above
In the song in the sky, a fire burns
A fire burns, a fire burns and it's for you"

My love for you is an ocean's roar
It's grown so strong that I can't let you go
That's why my love, my love is
An ocean's roar

My love is longer than forever
And endless as the march of time
'Till ninety-nine years after never
In my heart you'll still be mine
Because my love

My love is a deep blue sea
So deep, so deep that I'll never be free
My love for you is a deep blue sea
It's grown so strong that I'll never be free
That's why my love
My love is a deep blue sea"
ML1425,Linda Ronstadt,Little Girl Blue ,"Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do
Old girl you're through
Sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use old girl
You may as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue

When I was very young
The world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with every star in the sky
Above the ring I love so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the tinsel and gold

All you can count on is the raindrops"
ML1426,Bobby Womack,If You Think You're Lonely Now,"[Intro]
I wanna dedicate this song to all the lovers tonight
And I expect that might be the whole world
Because everybody needs something or someone to love

[Verse 1]
When it's cold outside, who are you holding?
You know
If y'all don't mind, I'd like to talk about this woman of mine
She's always complaining 'bout me never being at home
But when I'm there, I'm broke
She's telling me 'bout the things that her girlfriend's got
What she ain't got
And she want me to go out and get' em for her, but
But girl, I can't be in two places at one time

[Chorus]
If you think you're lonely now, huh
Wait until tonight, girl
I'll be long gone (If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right (Wait until tonight, girl)

[Verse 2]
When I ain't there to rub your back (If you think you're lonely now)
Just remember I made it a known fact (Wait until tonight, girl)
And the skeletons come out of the closet (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And chase you all around your room (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And the memories sail 'round like a ghost (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And dance around in a sad slow tune, ah

[Chorus]
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)
I'll be long gone (If you think you're lonely now)
And you'll never find another man that'll treat you right (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Wait, wait until tonight, girl (Wait until tonight, girl)

[Verse 3]
Girl, ain't it funny how the tables turn? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
When things aren't going your way (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
But when love walks out, and the pain walks in
And settles for a stay, ooh

[Chorus]
Lord, help me (If you think you're lonely now)
I feel like I wanna testify (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
Girl, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely, lonely, lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, just wait until tonight, girl (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)

[Verse 4]
You see, tonight's the night when the needs come out (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
When your needs come out to breathe
And the toils and snares, and there ain't now way you can sleep, oh

[Chorus]
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
I feel like I wanna testify this evening (Wait until tonight, girl)
I'm lonely, 'cause I know I gotta leave you, oh, girl (If you think you're lonely now)
I just can't take no more (Wait until tonight, girl)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (If you think you're lonely now)
Oh, girl, you just wait (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
If you think you got problems now, baby, you just wait
Wait (Wait until tonight, girl)
(If you think you're lonely now)
Too far gone, I'm packing up now (Wait until tonight, girl)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, babe (If you think you're lonely now)
(Wait until tonight, girl)
You say you're a little lonely (If you think you're lonely now)
But everybody needs somebody to love
(Wait until tonight, girl)

[Verse 5]
It's good that you know that you got somebody that'll stand by your side (If you think you're lonely now)
That'll build you up when you're falling down (Wait until tonight, girl)
And you had that someone, baby (If you think you're lonely now)
'Cause I've done my time
And it's your turn now (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think you're lonely now (If you think you're lonely now)
Wait, wait until tonight (Wait until tonight, girl)

[Outro]
I'm tired (If you think you're lonely now)
I'm tired of the same old shuck and jive (You just wait until tonight, girl)
It's been too long
If you think we could start all over again (If you think you're lonely now)
It's been too long (Wait until tonight, girl)
If you think we could start just one more time
(If you think you're lonely now)"

ML1430,Phil Perry,If Only You Knew,"I must have rehearsed my lines a thousand times
Until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve to tell you the words
Just never seem to come out right

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

I dreamed of moments we share but you're not there
I'm living in a fantasy
'Cause you don't even suspect, could probably care less
About the changes I've been going through

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do need you

If only you knew how much I do
I do love you
If only you knew how much I do
I do love you

If only you knew just how much I do
Do love you
If only you knew just how much I do
Do love you

If only you knew just how much I do

I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color, when black is burned?
What is the color?

You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

I'd like to know what you learned

Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby, with you

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you

(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
(Lonely avenue) Yes sir

And my pillow, it feels like stone
Well, I've tossed and turned so every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
(I could die, I could die, I could die)
'Cause I live on a lonely avenue
Yes sir (lonely avenue)

Lonely avenue

Now I've been so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child, I would be highway bound

I live on a lonely avenue
My little girl wouldn't say I do
Well, I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you

ML1445,Kurt Elling,Say It ,"Say it over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine
Tell me ever and ever so sweet
Soft words of love be repeating
Just like an old valentine
When you say I love you
The same old i love you
They whisper in stories and plays
You can change i love you
Same old i love you
To oh such a heaveny phrase
So say it softly and gently and then
Over and over again
Never stop saying you're mine"
ML1446,Norah Jones,Shoot The Moon,"[Verse 1]
The summer days are gone too soon
You shoot the moon and miss completely
And now you're left to face the gloom
The empty room that once smelled sweetly

[Chorus 1]
Of all the flowers you plucked if only
You knew the reason
Why you had to each be lonely
Was it just the season?

[Verse 2]
And now the fall is here again
You can't begin to give in, it's all over
When the snows come rolling through
You're rolling too with some new lover

[Chorus 2]
Will you think of times you told me
That you knew the reason
Why we had to each be lonely?
It was just the season

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
Will you think of times you told me
That you knew the reason
Why we had to each be lonely?
It was just the season"

A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamed
That you were here with me
And we were in each other's arms
It was oh so heavenly
You held me close to you
And whispered in my ear
Let's spend the night together
Sharing love beyond the bed

[Pre-Chorus]
As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share
And the music stopped
In a flash I was all alone
It was just a dream
Haunting me once again

[Chorus]
A dream
A simple fantasy (Simple fantasy)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

[Verse 2]
The day you left
You said you would return
Just when you couldn't promise
That you needed some time alone
You said you'd love me
And someday our love would be
I couldn't understand it
I thought we were both happy

[Pre-Chorus]
As we danced to the melody
We had so much to share
Then the music stopped
In a flash I was all alone
It was just a dream
Haunting me once again, oh

[Chorus]
A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
(Relive this dream once more)
A dream
A simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
(Oh, oh oh)

Oh, a dream
A simple fantasy
(A simple fantasy that I)
That I
Wish was reality
That you
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more
A dream
A simple fantasy
That I
Wish was reality
That you (You, you, you)
Come knocking at my door
And we
Relive this dream once more

ML1450,Destruction,Hate Is My Fuel,"A poisoned culture - Based on lies, war & deceit
Slaughterhouse philosophy - Cruel butchers are hard to beat
The law of the game - Is the law of the bloody blade
Dictated by lunacy - It's the fail death serenade

War - As the essence of a painful life
Decay - The stream of death agony will ride

Hate - Hate is my fuel
The mob is just tool
Hate - Hate is my fuel
I'm the lord of misrule

Death brings us together as one - The feel to be second to none
Shameful should be the gluttonous - What makes a real genius?
Erases all the treasures - Wipes out all fame, affluence and wealth
Recognize the afterlife freedom - Won't be based on stealth

War - As the essence of a painful life
Decay - The stream of death agony will ride

Hate - Hate is my fuel
The mob is just tool
Hate - Hate is my fuel
I'm the lord of misrule

Insanity - We do rape, wreck and then - We search for an excuse
Decay - We all gonna rot, we're all the same on the final cruise
Modesty - Is so hard to find, is this a curse - Is this real?
Consistency - Is a gift of life, education is the deal

Anda y ve, té esta esperando
Anda y ve, no lo hagas por mí
Que al fin y al cabo somos solo amigos
Anda y ve, te veo nerviosa
Anda y ve, y que sientes con él
Lo que en su día tu sentías conmigo
Pero lo dudo
Conmigo té mecías en el aire
Volabas en caballo blanco el mundo
Y esas cosas no podrán volver
Y es que lo dudo
Porque hasta a veces me has llorado por un beso
Llorando de alegría y no de miedo
Y lo dudo que te pase igual con él
Igual con él

Llorando de alegría y no de miedo

Anda y ve entrégale todo el amor que un día mío fue
Todo lo que te enseñe puedes gozarlo ha su lado
Pero no pienses en mi
Es un punto ya pasado y olvidado
Anda y ve entregale todo el amor que un dia mio fue
Yo no te prometi nada que no pudiera cumplir
Te enseñe lo que es cariño
Te enseñe lo que es vivir pero hasta ahi anda
Y ve entregale te esta esperando
Mira anda y ve vete con el anda
Y ve entregale todo el amor que un dia mio
Fue me has llorado por un beso suplicando mis caricias
Asi yo te espero ver parada en la misma esquina mi china"

[Verso 1]
Amanece un nuevo día
Otra noche sin dormir
Recordando los momentos
De mi vida junto a ti

[Verso 2]
En la puerta del colegio
Donde yo te conocí
Un tropiezo y unos libros
Que cayeron para que
Mirándonos los dos
Habláramos sin voz
Yo nervioso
Y tu apenada
Sentimos que el amor
Se despertaba

[Coro]
Cada puerta de un colegio es
Culpable de nuestro amor
Cada puerta de un colegio es
La que me recuerda a ti
Ahora que no estás aquí
Cada puerta de un colegio es
Como una mirada atrás
Cada puerta de un colegio es
Donde puedo ir a llorar
Pensando que estás detrás

[Verso 3]
Te sentabas a mi lado
En las clases de inglés
Entre risas y caricias
Planeábamos qué hacer

[Verso 4]
Cuando el año, se acababa
Me dijiste escúchame
Tengo que cambiar de curso
Y me iré muy lejos
Pero pronto volveré
El mundo se me hundió
Me rogaste que te esperara
Pero es tan duro amor
Te echo de menos

[Coro]
Cada puerta de un colegio es
Culpable de nuestro amor
Cada puerta de un colegio es
La que me recuerda a ti
Ahora que no estás aquí
Cada puerta de un colegio es
Como una mirada atrás
Cada puerta de un colegio es
Donde puedo ir a llorar, a soñar, a esperar
Te hecho de menos"

Dark is the light, the man you fight with all your prayers, incantations

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it!
No international security, no call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill a man, history teaches us so
The reason he must attain must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war

Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore

Of war! We don't speak anymore!

That's why I fight fire with fire
Oh I'm burning inside and my heart is a-cryin'

Standing alone
In a crowded room
I can feel a chill in the air
I'm shakin'

I'm miles away
I want to cry out loud
I want to fight till the end
I won't let 'em take me alive

And you know I'll fight fire with fire
Oh I'm burning inside and my heart is a-cryin'
Fire with fire
'Cause I'm never gonna lose this flamin' desire"
ML1464,The Beatles,Real Love,"[Verse 1: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Is waiting for you

[Verse 2: John Lennon & John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all we really were doing
Is waiting for love

No need to be alone
No need to be alone

It's real love
It's real

ML1465,The Roots,The Fire ,"[Intro: John Legend]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
The fire, the fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh
The fire, the fire

[Hook: John Legend]
There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul start to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the hole of where the torch goes
And in tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a lifetime
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or cancelling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes say I'm so close to having the prize
I realized I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

[Hook: John Legend]
There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
'Cause I'm the definition of tragedy-turned-triumph
It's David and Goliath, I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time start to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush, it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye-to-eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake

[Break: John Legend]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
The fire, the fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh
The fire, the fire

[Hook: John Legend]
There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn
You don't say, ""Good luck""
You say, ""Don't give up""
It's the fire, inside you
Let it burn

Oh-oh-oh-oh

ML1466,The Used,Burning Down The House,"Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool babies, strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

Hold tight, wait 'til the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

Here's your ticket, pack your bag, time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire

All wet, hey, you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place, sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work, say, baby, what did you expect?
Gonna burst into flame

Burning down the house

My house is out of the ordinary
That's right, don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can knock me off my feet
Burning down the house

No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin' yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect, stare into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire"
ML1467,Los Bukis,Contra Viento Y Marea,"Yo no sé cuanto dure lo nuestro
Si es para siempre o un día terminará
Lo cierto es que es algo tan especial
Que no merece acabar

Puede ser que en alguna otra parte
Tengamos cada cual algo mejor
Algunas cosas de mas
Mas dudo que encontremos nuevamente este amor

Cuantos hay que en la vida
Se pasan buscando el amor
Sin nada conseguir

Cuantos pierden dejando volar
Lo que tal vez nunca ha de regresar

Por eso aunque el mundo entero en nosotros no crea
Mientras exista nuestro amor
Triunfará... contra viento y marea

Cuantos hay que en la vida
Se pasan buscando el amor
Sin nada conseguir

Cuantos pierden dejando volar
Lo que tal vez nunca ha de regresar

Por eso aunque el mundo entero en nosotros no crea
Mientras exista nuestro amor
Triunfará... contra viento y marea

Sí... contra viento y marea"

ML1469,Anna Calvi,Desire,"I wanna go to the sun
Hold my life like I've never done
But it's just the devil in me
The devil that's calling as I come undone

The sky is getting dark tonight
Darker than the fear that's gonna pull us apart
The beating is the sound of love
The sound of love is beating like a fevered heart

[Chorus]
And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly
Desire, desire

I wanna lay in the dust
The dust is gonna fall here when I lie
God knows it's just the devil in me
The devil that's taking my hand to the fire

I never wanna leave you now
Leave you like the sun is gonna disappear
But it's just believing now
Believing in my heart is what I've come to fear

And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly
Desire, desire
Desire, desire
I've got desire, desire
I've got desire, desire

And only the lonely
Only the lonely fall
Only the lonely
Only the lonely fall
Fall

Oh, and I go to the fire
But God knows it's the sound of, it's the sound of love
It's the beat of my heart that you
Finally beating, it's coming, coming, coming for you

And it's just the devil in me
It's just a door to the devil gathered in disguise
Taking me by the hand
And leading me, leading me off to the fire

And it's the fire, the fire, the fire
It's heavenly, heavenly

[Verso 1]
La de lentes, la pasada de moda
La aburrida, la intelectual
La que prefiere una biblioteca a una discoteca
Es con la que vivo yo
La que todos tachan de fea
Y en el bus nadie le cede el lugar
La que es más que una presea para enseñar
Jamás será modelo de televisión
Porque aún no hacen anuncios para el corazón

[Coro]
Me gusta porque es auténtica y vive sin recetas
De esas que tratan de vestir al amor de etiqueta
He venido a parar con la mujer que no soñé jamás
Pero también jamás fui tan feliz

[Verso 2]
La que ya ni se pinta la boca
Defraudada de coquetear
La que es más que una aguja para enhebrar
Si su enemigo aparece acechando el espejo
Ella le da una sonrisa y aniquila el complejo

[Coro]
Me gusta porque es auténtica y vive sin recetas
De esas que tratan de vestir al amor de etiqueta
He venido a parar con la mujer que no soñé jamás
Es una estrella fugaz

[Coro]
Me gusta porque es auténtica y vive sin recetas
De esas que tratan de vestir al amor de etiqueta
He venido a parar con la mujer que no soñé jamás
Pero también jamás fui tan feliz"

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses
Dream of the perfect life
Economic circumstances
The body is good business
Sell out, maintain the interest
Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure

[Verse 2]
Coercion of the senses
We're not so gullible
Our great expectations
A future for the good
Fornication makes you happy
No escape from society
Natural is not in it
Your relations are of power
We all have good intentions
But all with strings attached

ML1472,Stevie Wonder,Ordinary Pain,"[Verse 1]
When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away, you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

[Verse 2]
When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over, in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back?
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
Your heart
In your heart
In your heart

[Verse 3: Shirley Brewer]
You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a playboy, you said no (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This little girl mind, you will blow (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But then it blew you out the box (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I put my stuff on key and lock (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
It makes me feel kind of sick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
To know love put you in a trick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I knew our love would have to end (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
The day I made it with your friend (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Giving your love to one unreal (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Like a big fool, I know you feel (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But in this lovie-dovie game (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
With all its joy, there must be pain (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But now the time has surely come (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This game don't seem like so much fun (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're crying big crocodile tears (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Don't match the ones I've cried for years (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I was home waiting for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You were out somewhere doing the do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You know I'd really like to stay (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But like you did, I've got to play (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're dumb to think I'd let you be (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Scott-free without some pain from me (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I heard your song and took a chance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But to your music, I can't dance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Go tell your story, sob-sad (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
About you blowing what you had (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Since one ain't good enough for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Then do yourself, see how you do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

'Cause a pipe dream gets flushed away

Behold, I
Crawl!
War!

[Verse 1]
Do you hear revolution's call?
Time to fight our own denial
Warmongers keep us locked in fear
Invoke the past, a moment of tears
An ugly truth, put forth by our youth
Under the threat of patriotic brute

So use your rage!
It is a weapon, we now must engage
Let trumpets sound our call!
Or by their lies we will fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing!

[Chorus]
Sing revolution's song (When they say die!)
Die for America!

[Lead - Flynn]

[Lead - Demmel]

[Refrain 1]
War!

[Verse 2]
They say that freedom isn't free
It's paid with the lives of sons and families
'Cause blood is their new currency
And oil pumps the heart of money

So fight as one, without a fucking gun
Words are the bullets to this revolution

Use your pain!
The battlegrounds, the streets are ablaze
Excess will pave their path!
The winds of change, our bloodbath

[Pre-Chorus]
Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing!

Sing revolution's song (When they say die!)
Die for America!

Scream, choking with foot upon throat
Blind, scar spangled eyes
Death, no more the truth you will hide
No, no!

[Bridge 3]
So how do they sleep?
While our mothers weep
They're selling our souls
And our blood for oil

[Verse 3]
Our generation can be the fucking one
That overcomes the greed of corrupt nations
Have no shame!
You're not alone in thinking this is fucking insane
Rise up and take your stand!
And curl the fingers of your hand

[Verse 4]
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't have the answers
But with every ounce of strength
I'll vow to fight this cancer
Didn't say I want to lead
I just might let you down
Didn't say believe in me
Just hold this common ground
I'm just as lost as you
And probably more confused
So fucking far from perfect
My mind wrecked from abuse
There's something fucking wrong
When war takes sons and daughters
Our lambs misled to slaughter!

[Outro]
War!

Lies!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Fear!
Clenching the fists of dissent

Clenching to hope!"
ML1492,Patti LaBelle,Over The Rainbow,"Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true

Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
Some day I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemondrops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?"

""The mind is fear""

Hate, war and terror, murder, disaster
Rape, drugs and violence, lost in our failure

Fear is control, suffering is hell
Police enforce obedient behavior
Manufactured weapon of conformity

Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Failure
What do you fear?

(""Fear"")
(""The mind is fear"")

It is the most strategic tool used to manipulate
Intimidation to make me weak in order to obey
Strategy to manipulate, paralyze, intimidate
Righteous greed suffocates, a powerful fear campaign
Mind killing, restricting
Fear is the enemy on my path
Mind killing, restricting
Fear is the enemy on my path

Fears of war and pestilence
Fear of loss and failure
Fear the hate of your enemy
Fear your god and savior
Failure

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Verse 2]
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

On the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So, their love could never be

[Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Verse 2]
He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her brave

[Chorus]
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

[Verse 3]
Running Bear dove in the water
Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other
Through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met
The raging river pulled them down
Now, they'll always be together
In that happy huntin' ground

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove

ML1505,The Used,Blue And Yellow,"[Verse 1]
And it's all in how you mix the two
And it starts just where the light exists
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you're never gonna find it if you're looking for it
Won't come your way, yeah
Well, you'll never find it if you're looking for it (Looking for it)

Should've done something, but I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you

And you never would have thought, in the end
How amazing it feels just to live again

And it burns a hole through everyone that feels it

Won't come your way, yeah
Well, you'll never find it if you're looking for it

ML1506,Lucinda Williams,Kiss Like Your Kiss,"There'll never be a spring so perfect again
We'll never see a yellow so rich
The grass will never be quite as green
And there will never be a kiss like your kiss

There will never be a summer so complete
We'll never see a palette like this
The berries will never taste as sweet
There will never be a kiss like your kiss

There will never be an autumn so vivid and warm
So rare, so gold and so crisp
We'll never see it colored in aubergine
There will never be a kiss like your kiss

There'll never be a winter quite so true
When the sky is painted with gifts
And there'll never be a moon so full and blue
There will never be a kiss like your kiss
There will never be a kiss like your kiss"

ML1508,Randy Newman,It's Money That I Love,"[Verse 1]
I don't love the mountains
I don't love the sea
I don't love Jesus
He never done a thing for me
I ain't pretty like my sister
Smart like my dad
Or good like my mama

[Chorus]
It's money that I love
It's money that I love

[Verse 2]
They say that money
Can't buy love in this world
But it'll get you a half-pound of cocaine
And a sixteen-year-old girl
And a great big long limousine
On a hot September night
Now that may not be love
But it is all right

[Chorus]
One, two
It's money that I love
Wanna kiss you
Three, four
It's money that I love

[Verse 3]
Used to worry 'bout the poor
But I don't worry anymore
Used to worry 'bout the black man
Now I don't worry 'bout the black man
Used to worry about the starving children of India
You know what I say now about the starving children of India?
I say, ""Oh, mama""

[Chorus]
It's money that I love
It's money that I love

It's money that I love
It's money that I love
It's money that I love
It's money that I love

Are you ready?

[Verse 1: Jonathan Davis]
There's a place inside my mind
A place I like to hide

You don't know the chances
What if I should die?
A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Another place I'll find
To escape the pain inside

I'm so blind
Blind, blind

Deeper and deeper and deeper
As I dream to live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner
Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go
In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind?
This time I look to see what's between the lines

[Pre-Chorus: Jonathan Davis]
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind
I can see, I can see I'm going blind

I can see, I can see I'm going blind (I can see I'm going)

We may never understand
If love just happens or it's planned

And now this heartbeat wants control, ooh baby

Tire tracks in the basement to what you might fall

You didn't try cashin' in
That's not my fault

Where are the beggars when I need to look good?
I sure don't want my life as a stroller
And I wouldn't put my life in the hands of a stranger

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

I sure don't want my life as a stroller
And I wouldn't put my life in the hands of a stranger

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath

When you panic
Do you count to ten
When you're surrounded
Do you hold your breath"

Enter the mirror

Discard the real

Listen too long
So play along
One seldom viewed
Policing I'm told jut out

Shooting the breeze
And see her now
Confide in you
True images found and cut (and cut)

Sharpened angle in the dirt
You don't walk for an hour

First offensive has been shot
Lost your footing
Hopeless now
Covered metal on the wall
You can lend another skin

Twice now fixed on such a mess
Subtle green and send it back
Precious ornament to crack
It's an overwhelming lie

Didn't we move the earth
Didn't we shoot for the sky

And didn't we catch the fire
And didn't we call upon the spirits
And didn't we fall together
And didn't we die for love

Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me

Breathe in the sweet fire of love (I'm not afraid anymore)
Sweet, sweet fire (I'm not alone)
Breathe in the sweetest fire of love (I'm not the same anymore)
Sweet, sweet fire (The sweet fire of love)
The sweet fire of love

Didn't we cross new waters
Didn't we mix new blood
Didn't we build brand new bridges
Didn't we hold back the flood

Broken idols by the side of the road
They didn't fall on the side of the law
Here she comes a-shining like a light
Here she comes, salvation in the night

Days on the run
Nights in hiding
Hoping that you were
The healing inside me

Sweet, sweet fire (I'm not alone)
Breathe in the sweet fire of love (I'm not the same anymore)
Sweet, sweet fire (The sweet fire of love)

Didn't we bear the cross
Didn't we bring down the hammer
Didn't we beat on the drum

ML1523,Procol Harum,Conquistador,"Conquistador your stallion stands
In need of company
And like some angel's haloed brow
You reek of purity
I see your armour-plated breast
Has long since lost its sheen
And in your death mask face
There are no signs which can be seen

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador a vulture sits
Upon your silver shield
And in your rusty scabbard now
The sand has taken seed
And though your jewel-encrusted blade
Has not been plundered still
The sea has washed across your face
And taken of its fill

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

Conquistador there is no time
I must pay my respect
And though I came to jeer at you
I leave now with regret
And as the gloom begins to fall
I see there is no, only all
And though you came with sword held high
You did not conquer, only die

And though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind"
ML1524,Exodus,Bonded By Blood,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Black magic rites on this black evil night
Begin with the slice of the blade
Metal and blood come together as one
Onlookers, they gasp in dismay
Taste the sweet blood of one another
Sharing without any greed
Bang your head, as if up from the dead
Intense metal is all that you need

[Chorus]
Murder in the front row
Crowd begins to bang and there's blood upon the stage
Bang your head against the stage and metal takes its price
Bonded by blood

[Verse 2]
Metal takes hold, death starts to unfold
It's loud like the world's at an end
You're in a blood fury, the metal won't stop
Onlookers, they bang at command
Cutting your palm and drinking your blood
The power that few others dare
You feel the need to go out and kill
The same need that your blood brother shares

[Chorus]
Murder in the front row
Crowd begins to bang and there's blood upon the stage
Bang your head against the stage and metal takes its price
Bonded by blood

Intense metal is all that you need

Murder in the front row

Bang your head against the stage and metal takes its price
Bonded by blood"

Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waiting
Just anticipating all my love

I spent a night in L.A
Just another chance to see you

I've ever cared for in this world (oh oh)

Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you

ML1526,Iron Maiden,Be Quick Or Be Dead,"[Verse 1]
Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making your money
From slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives
In your schemes and your powers

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief in your head

Be quick or be dead
Be quick (quick, quick, quick)
Or be dead (dead, dead, dead)

See... who's pulling strings
See... what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face...
Your belly will hold you in place

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote
For what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong
As long as you're all right
So, pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them

ML1527,Deadmau5,Outta My Life,"And you know I can't hold on
'Cause I can't miss you while you go
All these years I've cried and you know I've tried
You never lived out the way that you like

And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
And let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget

If you walk out don't look back
Don't ever be at what we had
And I'm not sorry but I can't forget
You left me bitter by the things you said

And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
And let the rain wash away the regret
I don't need you to help me forget

And you know I can't hold on
'Cause I can't miss you while you go
All these years I've cried and you know I've tried
You never lived out the way that you like

And I know your darkness deep inside
Walk away from the hurt that you left behind
And let the rain wash away the regret

If you walk out don't look back
Don't ever be at what we had

ML1528,Eliza Gilkyson,Looking For A Place,"Strap my derriere to a padded chair
I fly the air in a tin can
From here to there on a wing and a prayer
I don't even know where I am
I'm a wanderin fool burnin fossil fuel
Sending arrows into the dark
But I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart

Throw all of my junk into the Alamo trunk
And I pull out into the lane
Cell phone's dead there's mountains ahead
I don't even slow down for the rain
There was a time when the road was mine
And the path was lined with sparks
Now I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart

It's in the air the scent of despair
Nobody wants to talk about it
We're all scared we're gonna lose our share of the dream
Can't live without it

My clothes are funky I'm a sugar junkie
I'm a promo monkey in a cage
I lunge for the carrot repeat like a parrot
Til I step out onto the stage
The lights go down and I see your faces
Shinin through the dark
And I'm just lookin for a place where I can fall apart
Oh can I let my guard down tonight?
Is it safe enough to fall apart?"
ML1529,Calexico,Victor Jara's Hands,"Wire fences still coiled with flowers of the night
Songs of the birds like hands call the earth to witness
Sever from fear before taking flight

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's Hands

Me siento solo y perdido
Una vela alumbra mi camino
Cruzando tierras que nunca he visto
Cruzando el río de mi destino
Solo soy un chico mas
Que sueña en alto y mirando al mar

Fences that fail and fall to the ground
Bearing the fruit from Jara's Hands"
ML1530,Warren Haynes,On A Real Lonely Night,"You've been out of my life sometime now
Seem like a long, long while
Sometimes the thoughts of you
Bring tears to my eyes

While the times that bring a smile
I remember what you told me
We would always be close in our hearts
Must be easy to sleep in another man's arms
We're so damn far apart

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
Just making me a fool
I can almost see your face
On a real lonely night

There's a picture of you hanging on my wall
Such a lovely girl
Sometimes I feel like breaking into pieces
Like you did to my world

Oh, and other times I wanna hold her in my arms
Like a ball in chain
I look till I'm through loving you
I can never love again

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
Just making me a fool
On a real lonely night
Just no way to pass the time

I walk around and I talk to myself
Pretending that it's you
I can almost see your face

I can't hold you
Like we used to do

On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing
And feel your warm breath on my skin
Just making me a fool
On a real lonely night
Just no way to pass the time

I walk around and I talk to myself
Pretending that it's you, yes, I do
I can almost see your face
I can almost see your face

On a real lonely night
On a real lonely night
On a real lonely night
I can almost hear you laughing"

Do you believe in life after death? (Life after death)

Wandering forever
In the darkest of shadows

ML1534,Cristian,Amor,"[Verso 1]
Mi vida sin tu amor, será
Como un camino que no sabe a donde va
Solo un recuerdo del pasado
Una historia que ha llegado a su final

Mi vida sin tu amor, sera
La de un amante con un roto corazón
Mi vida sin tu amor
Es barco en alta mar
Sin puerto ni ilusión

[Estribillo]
Mi vida sin tu amor no es mas
Que el crudo invierno de mi soledad
En el silencio de la inmensidad
Un alma que no encuentra su lugar

Mi vida sin tu amor no es mas
Que el tibio abrazo que no volverá
Sera la soledad de estar sin ti
Yo sin tu amor
Yo sin tu amor no se vivir

[Verso 2]
Mi vida sin tu amor, será
Como un enigma que no tiene solución
Mi vida sin tu amor
Es nube que se va
Tu adiós se la llevo

[Estribillo]
Mi vida sin tu amor no es mas
Que el crudo invierno de mi soledad
En el silencio de la inmensidad
Un alma que no encuentra su lugar

Mi vida sin tu amor no es mas
Que el tibio abrazo que no volverá
Sera la soledad de estar sin ti
Yo sin tu amor
Yo sin tu amor no se vivir"
ML1535,Aterciopelados,Rompecabezas,"[Letra de ""Rompecabezas""]

[Verso 1]
Y es que fueron, fueron tus abrazos
Que como sablazos me hicieron pedazos
Afiladas fueron tus miradas
Quedé destrozada y en llanto inundada
Roja y loca, la flama de tu boca
Me quemó y apagarme me toca

[Coro]
Empiezo una nueva vida
Un rompecabezas que tendré que armar
Bien lejos, lejos de su influjo
De esa cruel fragancia que invadió mi ser

[Verso 2]
De la maleza surgieron tus promesas
Germinando tristeza en mi cabeza
Tu bajeza me tomó por sorpresa
Para lastimar, tienes mucha destreza
Qué delicia fueron tus caricias
Mala noticia, eran pura malicia

[Coro]
Empiezo una nueva vida
Un rompecabezas que tendré que armar
Bien lejos, lejos de su influjo
De esa extravagancia que torció mi fe

[Puente]
Ya no quiero ir hacia usted corriendo
Ya no quiero más gritar su nombre

[Outro]
Bien lejos, lejos de su influjo
De la casi muerte que fue su querer
Empiezo"

Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs to tell me which way I should go
To find the answer and all the time I know, plant your love and let it grow

Let it grow, let it grow
Let it blossom, let it flow
In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, let it grow

Looking for a reason to check out of my mind
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on, but there's nothing left to show
Plant your love and let it grow

In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, so let it grow

Only ask and you will get what you are needing, the rest is up to you
Plant your love and let it grow

In the sun, the rain, the snow
Love is lovely, so let it

Nightmare!
(Now your nightmare comes to life)

[Verse 1]
Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
(Peace of mind is less than never!)
Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
(Burn the world your last endeavor!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (Steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning
Haunting, yearning, pull the trigger!

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare
(While your nightmare comes to life)

[Verse 2]
Can't wake up in sweat
'Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancin' with your demons

Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
(Loathing self-assassination!)

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (Feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane, they tell ya
""Given with the best intentions
Help you with your complications!""

[Chorus]
You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah

Fight (Fight!)
Not to fail (Fail!)

Unh!

Down (Down!)
Feel the fire (Fire!)
Feel the hate (Hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!)
Hit the wall (Wall!)
Watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar

[Bridge]
And I know you hear their voices
(Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real
(These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices
(Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
(As your nightmare comes to life)

[Chorus]
You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare"

叫ぶ事を忘れたのならば　ここで叫び　ここに生きろ
何度死んでも叫び向かうさ　声を壊し　声を殺せばいい
叫ぶ事を忘れたのならば　ここで叫び　ここに生きろ
何度死んでも叫び向かうさ　声を壊し心で叫べばいい
We can dive"

Ella es aún muy joven, apenas sus 16
Él mucho mayor que ella con casi sus 36
Ella con su inocencia de niña lo conquistó
Él no se dio ni cuenta que de ella se enamoró

El amor nos puede hacer sufrír
Porque él pertenece a otra mujer
Ella comienza a vivir y él la empieza a querer
El amor, así es el amor, nos hace sufrír y llorar
Cuándo se ama de verdad y se entrega el corazón

Y que vives esperando que otros, arreglen las cosas
Mientras tu disfrutas, de lo que ellos consiguen

Yo traigo la verdad en mi palabra
Vengo a decirte de un niño sin abrigo
Vengo a decirte que hay inviernos que nos muerden
De la falta de un amigo

Vengo a contarte que hay luces que nos hieren
Que existen noches sin whiskys ni placeres
Vengo a decirte que esta cerca tu condena
Hoy una madre murió de pena

Déjame cantar tengo vergüenza
De ser humano como tu y en tu presencia
Descubrirme a mi mismo en tu figura
Que poca cosa somos sin ternura

A ti que aún puedes reír, tan solo vengo a pedirte
Un pequeño favor, que me des un minuto
De tu tiempo mejor para darte lo mío
En mi, mejor canción

Yo traigo la verdad en mi palabra
Vengo a decirte de un niño sin abrigo
Vengo a decirte que hay inviernos que nos muerden

Vengo a contarte que hay luces que nos hieren
Que existen noches sin whiskys ni placeres
Vengo a decirte que esta cerca tu condena

Descubrirme a mi mismo en tu figura

ML1554,R. Kelly,Touched A Dream,"Girl you just don't know
Last night was incredible. Listen. Check it out

Last night, I felt the skies open up and rain down heaven
Last night, I felt the sun, the moon and the stars come together
Last night, I heard an angel speak to me he said us forever
And while we were making love, I saw visions of a tropical river

Last night I
Touched a dream
When you were here with me
Last night I
Touched a dream
Girl you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
Said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Last night you brought my dreams to reality

Now last night, I could have sworn I saw an eagle spread his wings
Last night, I heard a massive choir lift their voice and sing
Last night, I saw the world living in peace and harmony
While we were making love, I felt my soul being set free

Last night I
Touched a dream
You were here with me
Last night I
Touched a dream
And you fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
I said we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Ooh yeah, girl you brought my dreams to reality

After the rain comes the rainbow
The sun will shine after the storm
Oh yes it will and Mother Nature guarantees
Jumped the mountain and touched the sky
Over the sea baby we can fly
When we made love I see the flowers the trees the birds the bees

Last night I touched a dream girl
Touched a dream
You right here with me
Touched a dream
Ohhh ohh oooh a dream
Touched a dream
You fulfill my fantasy oh baby yes you did
Touched a dream
And baby we rewrote the book of love making history yeah yeah

Girl, you brought my dreams to a reality yeah hey
Last night when you were lying next to me
Touched a dream
You fulfill my fantasy
Touched a dream
Yeah

And baby we rewrote the book of love making history
Touched a dream
Forever I have a dream
A vision of you right there with me
I know you're my love making queen
Touched a dream
And I am your love making king
Let no man or woman come between
What God has given you and me
Touched a dream
The laws of reciprocity
And give those amorocity (bootlegged form the word amorist)
Provided us with food to eat
Touched a dream
Fills our vacancies but together the perfect chemistry
Forever anniversaries
Touched a dream
You're the root to my tree, I'm a branch you're a leaf
The apple carrying my seed
Touched a dream
Fall, winter, summer, spring
That's why I ain't gon' let the devil steal my joy from me cause I done
Touched a dream
Touched a dream
Touched a dream"

I was hangin' by my thumb and slippin' on my feet
I had to take a break I couldn't stand the heat
Just when I thought I could never win
I was doing pretty good for the shape I was in

I went to the movies last night again
I couldn't stay long enough to see the end
'Cause there was something going on that I couldn't see
Everybody's making out in the balcony
I was missing out on the fun again
But I'm doing pretty good for the shape I'm in

I tried so hard to get back in the race
I'd just be satisfied if I could place
There's so much competition but the best don't always win
I'm doing pretty good for the shape I'm in

I went to a party and made a few passes
One was a dream and the other was nasty
Well, I guess you know by now that I did it again
But I was doing pretty good for the shape I was in
I was down like a dollar comin' up against a yen
I was doing pretty good for the shape I'm in
Doing pretty good for the shape I was in
Doing pretty good for the shape I was in

Mm, that's how it starts, it all started right there
What do you mean you need a break?
What do you mean the TV needs repair?
""Do I have to do everything?"" he asks
He says, ""I'm sick, yeah, I'm sick of this""
So he kills his wife and he kills his kids
That's what he did, hey

Be all you can be
The more that you seize
Will bring you your celebrity

[Verse 3]
Big TV attorneys, big TV covers
They put him on the stand in a Calvin Klein suit
Deals, we're making deals
Turning wheels, trying to get our best foot in the door
Justice, or what it seems
He's too nice to have done it anyway
Life, yeah, that's life
But no more than seven years and eighteen days
He gets caught up in the videos
Magazines and works out and finds the Lord
He loses the Lord and gets a book slash movie deal
For four, yeah, four pa

[Pre-Chorus]
Then he says, ""hey
Be all you can be
The more that you seize
Will bring you your celebrity""

ML1567,Big Head Todd & The Monsters,Please Don't Tell Her,"I always leave her waiting
I always leave her down
If she should come my way
I always turn around

Please don't tell her I love her
Please don't tell her I love her

I always keep her out
I never let her in
If she should come my way weeping
I greet her with a grin

Please don't tell her I love her
Please don't tell her I love her

If she should discover the colors of my love
She will fly, fly away

Now you can try tenderness
You can try to hang around
Oh, but I'm sure she'll love you less
I'm sure she'll bring you down

Please don't tell her I love her
Please don't tell her I love her"
ML1568,Aaron Lewis,Massachusetts,"[Verse 1]
I sit here on the stairs and listen to
The night time as the daylight fades away
It's such a haunting and familiar tune
When I hear it in the distance I can say

[Chorus]
That I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be
Because I'm home

[Verse 2]
The North Shore is where my father lives
I wear my Red Sox hat around the world with pride
But the Berkshires are where my heart is
And when I see them in the distance I could cry

[Chorus]
Because I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be

[Bridge]
Nyla started pre-school, and Indie just turned two
And Zoe's just the perfect mix of me and you
They keep getting older, and time keeps going by
To think about it makes your daddy wanna cry

[Verse 3]
So I just passed the sign that welcomes me to Worthington
Established long before this country came to be
A place that hasn’t really changed with time
The way this country that I love, it used to be

[Chorus]
Because I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my daughters and my wife they wait for me
All alone, but the truth is
It's where I always am, it's where I long to be

[Outro]
Because I'm home, in Massachusetts
Where my hero teaches classes everyday
Where my friends, don't treat me different
It's where my family is, it's where I'll always stay
Because I'm home"
ML1569,Fleetwood Mac,Songbird,"[Verse: Christine McVie]
For you, there'll be no more crying
For you, the sun will be shining

It's alright, I know it's right
To you, I will give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
'Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
And the songbirds are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

ML1570,Boston,Party,"[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, well you know I don't get off on working day after day
I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when it's going my way
And there's nothing like a party when its kicking into gear

I'm getting ready for a party tonight
Yes I'm getting ready to cruise
And if you've got something for me
I've got something for you

[Chorus]
Baby, it's a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party

[Verse 2]
I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
There's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on get ready for the time of your life
'Cause I'm getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
I've got something for you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Get down and party if you need a cue
You're sure to find one in the crowd
Just meet your friends and have a toke or two
In a place where they can never play the music too loud

[Pre-Chorus]
And get ready for a party tonight
Cause I'm getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
I've got something for you
You know what I'm talking about?

[Chorus]
Baby, it's a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party

[Verse 4]
Now a man doesn't live on bread alone
He's got to have some loving each and every night
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known
Let's get together honey, it's alright
I said, let's get together honey, it's alright
So come on, let's get together honey, it's alright

[Outro]
Aww, get down
Get down and party"
ML1571,The Beatles,Maxwell's Silver Hammer,"[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?""
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be so, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead (Do-do-do-do-do)

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head (Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

There is no doubt
I can't fight it

Your point of view
In love
It's true
Seems you planned it
And when we touch
It's just enough
To understand it
Don't you know

Form the offset
The day we met
I knew I loved you
The stakes were set
I can't forget
What made me want you

Love's mysteries
Gave you and me
A new beginning
Now can't you see
How it can be
A happy ending
Don't you know

I love you more
More than you know
Gonna let it show"

Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you

If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 1: Musiq Soulchild]
Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400-SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly
I remember when you was just Tonya Hall
A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concerned, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours, but...

And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you
Even when we was younger, I admired you
That's why I used to always pick fights with you

Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games
Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane
Can we do that nowadays?

When we played hide and seek
Instead of you chasing me

To watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

The sky's alive with lights
A building in the distance
Surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach
Waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach
There's not a soul around

My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk

Stone you
Then turn and disown you

They'll walk all over your name
Till they find someone else to blame
Don't let it take the fight outta you
Secrets hide their lies
Inside hidden alibis
Don't let it take the fight outta you
They put the world on a hook
It's worse every time I look

I would rather take the punch
Than not give you a shot
I'd rather find out who you are
Than who you're not
Shoulda known better
Than to mistake business for love
Shoulda known better
Than to mistake a fist for a glove

It will be in your honor
Til you're not needed any longer
Don't let it take the fight outta you
Don't believe the headlines
Check it for yourself sometimes

Don't let it take the fight outta you
The lies you live become you
The love you lose it numbs you
Don't let it take the fight outta you
They say that you've arrived
That's just a high class bribe
Don't let it take the fight outta you

I would rather take your punch
Than not give you a shot
I'd rather find out who you are
Than who you're not
Shoulda known better
Than to mistake business for love
Shouda known better
Than to mistake a fist for a glove

Someone with more hunger

Waiting for a donor
Like a half empty balloon

Say man, she don't stop, she get it, get it, baby girl, the way she did it
Way she works her body makes a playa' wanna hit it
Did it up and down then she shook it all around
Shorty look at that and then she dropped it to the ground

Now I'm thinking I done found her panties roaming in the town
This girl was cuchie down, backside wasn't leaving ground
I was on it like a hound, got at her on the double
But been all up on her bubble, say man this girl is trouble

Baby girl, you know you're sexy the way you move you're body
Hope the music never stops, I like the way you wind
Don't pay me no attention, I'm just admiring that body
I'm enjoying my view strictly from behind

A fine tuned way of motion
A face wrapped for a suitor

ML1601,The Black Dahlia Murder,What A Horrible Night To Have A Curse,"This twisted, wretched place shadowed by the utmost darks of hell
In dreams of black, beyond the bounds of a withered witch's spell
Where the doors surely are locked when the sun threatens to wane
Where shamblers dwell in dim moon light beyond the warmth of day
Liars line the roads at dawn
Watchful eyes are upon you held
Sacred weapons to the sacred revealed to be unleashed its the council of hell
Blood flows down the streets at night where wolves cry out for flesh
Where a horrible curse taints the woodlands nearby with the forms of the walking dead
Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man
Into the tower, never go; the horrors multiply
The gears can mince the strongest ones, leaving heroes paralyzed
The rivers flow with poison
The sands swallow you whole
The ghouls that roam this darkened wood are thirsting for your throat

Unholy inversion of hope, twisting the faith of the meek into hate
Driven insane by the dark one, to bring forth the foul biddings he speaks
The undead are among us; at dawn they shrink back to their silken beds
They dance by night and drink the blood of a child's broken neck
His spires are growing taller still, their shadows spreading throughout the land
Freeing the evils that sleep within the weaker minds of man"

It's the devil, it's the boil, it's the black of night
In your head, in your head

Do you see the fire heavy lit before its time?
Know you the color of the end of the end of the end
Silence is dancing to a beating drum
Money is nothing but a loaded gun

And it's hard, oh it's hard to help yourself
When you don't know where to begin

Can you tame the demon?

And the fast blood
Hurricanes through me
And then it rips my roof away with her fire heads
This is the longest kiss

Because this fumble
Has become biblical
I feel like I just died twice
Was reborn again
For all our dirty sins

And try to fulfill your request
But don't ask for favors when it's time to leave
'Cause I'm not that lonely yet

I've heard that before
The words weigh like stones in my head
There may come a time when I'll think of it more
But I'm not that lonely yet

ML1611,Kyle Riabko,What Did I Get Myself Into,"Every day was filled with all the love and happiness
I could find in my life
There was nothing I could miss
It was easy
Easy

I had found the one before
I even knew her name
I was sure that when she left me
I would never feel the same
It was easy
Easy

What did I get myself into
I didn't realize the compromise
I put you through What did
I get myself into
And tell me how to get back into you

Now the reason for the complication's all because of me
I was sure it'd last forever
But I guess
I was naïve
It was easy
Easy

If I was the man, that I make myself to be
I would understand what understanding really means
If you could find it in your heart
To see what I'm going through"
ML1612,Of Montreal,Doing Nothing,"Nothing, we're doing nothing
Sitting and wondering why nothing's happening
Everyone was there
In a wooden chair
Doing nothing
Still doing nothing
Drinking, smoking
Nothing's happening
No one seems to care
In their wooden chair
Doing nothing

I go walking through the park
Underneath a moldy sky
Thinking ""yes I think this place
Would be such a lonely place to die
Such a lonely place to die

Nothing we're doing nothing
Literally frozen stiff from nothing happening
Something has to change
Cause it's no longer feeling strange
To do nothing Ad nauseam nothing
And feeling acutely every millisecond pass
We can ignore that this is sad
Because we know that it all adds up to nothing

I go walking though the park
Underneath the moldy sky
Thinking about all the different ways that would make lonely ways to die
All the lonely ways to die"

I am your sinking stone

Haven't you been through enough?

I am the cruel one
Don't know how I've become
A movie where the acting shows somebody you used to know
You used to know

Oh no
I don't want to wake up feeling like I'm no one
I don't want to wake up wondering how did I become the Cruel one

[Verse 2]
It's quicker than you think
Sadness spreads out like ink on the road and on the sea
On the roof and balcony

I was using loneliness and now it's using me
There's nothing left to give to you
One thing left to say to you

[Chorus]
Oh no
I don't want to wake up feeling like I'm no one
I don't want to wake up wondering how did I become the Cruel one

I don't want to waste my time
Standing in a waiting line
When I know what I want, and you're just what I want
I don't want to waste my days, worrying what they'll say

And I could take away the salt from your eyes
And take away what's been assaulting you
And I could give you my apologies
By handing over all the olive trees
And I could take away the shaking knees
And I could give you all the olive trees
Oh look at the trees and look at my face
And look at a place far away from here

So give me your eyes

Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain

A rose in the rain
So I swore to the razor
That never enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again?

Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance her to the moon

You preach every word you say
Your sticks and your stones break more than my bones

You say you love me, then you hate me, then you're hot then cold

And you fight like a little Contender
A broken heart you can never surrender

I want to love girl but somehow I can't let you in
Disguised in all your makeup like the seven sins
You've got your magic

ML1625,CeCe Winans,Away In A Manger,"Sleep little baby sleep

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep in the hay

And I welcome You in my heart
I pray that we will never part
This love You gave me
Is shining for the whole world to see
Shining for the whole world to see

The cattle are lowing, the sweet Baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love You, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay right by my side till morning is nigh

And I welcome You in my heart
I pray that we will never part
This love that You gave me
Is shining for the whole world to see
Shining for the whole world to see

Hear the words when
Darkness seems everywhere
People hurting
No one seems to care
We need Your love
To shine down on me

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask You to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live with You there

And I, I welcome You in my heart
I pray that You will never part
This love You gave me
Is shining

For unto us a child is born
Emmanuel
Prince of Peace
Everlasting Father
What a wonderful King
Keep shining so the whole world can see

Sleep little Jesus, sleep
Sleep little Jesus, sleep
Emmanuel
Sleep little Jesus, sleep
Sleep little Jesus, sleep"
ML1626,Daryl Hall & John Oates,Home For Christmas,"Home For Christmas
Leaves are fallin'
December is callin'
Feels like that time of the year
Ooh and a chill in my bones
Got me thinking of home
And everyone I hold dear
If ever I miss my connection
Stranded and feeling alone
But no matter how mean
This hard road treated me
I always could find my way home
Dont you know

That you are in my heart
And I always come home for Christmas
We're living apart
We're so close
We're so far
I'll still come home for Christmas
It might be just for a day
But I'll still come home for Christmas
Oh how I wish I could stay
But the years slip away
I come home for Christmas
And I'll always come home

I see all the lights
Someone told me tonight
Putting the star on the tree
It's a feeling I know
I'll never let go
Like my first holiday memory
Sometimes we all miss our connections
We're stranded and feeling alone
But no matter how mean
This hard road seems to be
We always could find our way home
Cause you know

That you are in my heart
And I always come home for Christmas
We're living apart
We're so close
We're so far
I'll still come home for Christmas
It might be just for a day
But I'll still come home for Christmas
Oh how I wish I could stay
But the years slip away
I come home for Christmas
And I'll always come home

But no matter how mean
This hard road treated me
I always could find my way home
Don't you know

That you are in my heart
And I always come home for Christmas
We're living apart
We're so close
We're so far
I'll still come home for Christmas
It might be just for a day
But I'll still come home for Christmas
Oh how I wish I could stay
But the years slip away
I come home for Christmas
And I'll always come home"

I'll be so blue just thinking about you

I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas

This Christmas, I'll be home with bells on

[Verse 1]
I've traveled 'round this country, crossed the waters deep and wide
Made lots of friends and memories, brought joy to other's lives
It's Christmas time again, another year has come and gone
And I can't keep from wonderin' how the old folks are at home, so

When the snow is on the meadow and the sleigh bells jingle bright
And the kids are singing ""Jingle Bells"" around the Christmas lights
As daddy stokes the fire and mama puts the turkey on
There ain't nothing going to slow me down, this Christmas, I'll be home

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'll be home with bells on
I'll be home with bells on
Trim the tree and wrap the presents, turn the Christmas music on

Crowded street, busy feet, hustle by him
Downtown shoppers, Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by

Should you stop? Better not, much too busy
You'd better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
(Willie Nelson)
And in the midst of the laughter he cries

Wrap your presents to your darling from you

Wrapped up with love

How I'm waiting for you, praying for you
I wanted you to see
So I'm sending you a little Christmas
Till you come home to me

Some gingerbread, a candy cane
A stocking I made with your name
I filled it with your favorite things
A way to say I love you
Like kisses through the air
Hoping you'll feel me there

So I'm sending you a little Christmas
Wrapped up with love

A little peace, a little light
To remind you of
How I'm waiting for you, praying for you
I wanted you to see

One little Christmas tree was standing alone
Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky

I'm so afraid and so alone
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small
Light up someone's home? 'Cause

One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy

Cried as she looked down at the tree
Oh, please Mr. Father tree wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me?
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down, little angel girl, and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world 'cause

[Chorus 2]
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world

Entombs the lifeless
The darkest black is cast
The shadow of the reaper, will you take its hand
The shadow of the reaper, the grave now calls to you

In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyes
In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyes

The cold grasp, a bloody hand
The skeleton, it cracks
And it's twitching
Inside of your body
The brain retreats
The heart beats no longer
In denial
Life no longer there
To comfort
To invigorate
To betray you
The rotten now await you

Meet the Devil's keeper
In the shadow of the reaper
The rotten now await you
To invade you

The shadow of the reaper, the shadow of the dead
Entombs the lifeless
The darkest black is cast
The shadow of the reaper, will you take its hand
The shadow of the reaper, the grave now calls to you

In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyes
In the cemetery
You have been left unburied
The vultures pick at your eyes"

While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God our King
And peace to men on earth!

Scars will heal, soon
The dregs in us spent the earth down

Children shouldn't play with dead things
Foaming crows tear at their wings
Sad eyes cry crimson blood

The tree is trimmed and in your favorite place

I sing, 'Jingle bells on a one horse open sleigh'
But white Christmas makes me blue
Every time I hear it play, I think of you
I remember all the good ones we knew
Oh, white Christmas makes me blue
I'm trying to be happy, I know you'd want me to
Being sad at Christmas time ain't right
I'm keeping our traditions, wishing you were here
On Christmas eve I still sing, 'Silent night'

Every time I hear it play, I think of you
I remember all the good ones we knew
Oh, white Christmas makes me blue
Oh, white Christmas makes me blue"

Ingrat tout comme ton physique
Tu as grandi dans ses bras
T'es nourri d'elle comme une tique

Et ton souffle dans ses peines
Noyé tes mots les plus farouches
Dans le flux brûlant de ses veines

Avec elle, tu n'auras jamais de mômes

T'as trempé ta plume dans ses larmes
Et mis son vin dans ton eau
T'as fait de sa beauté ton charme
Aujourd'hui, tu n'es même plus beau

Tu as vu midi à sa porte
Et ta force au creux de ses reins
Asphyxiée et laissée pour morte
Mais elle respire ce matin

Empiffré de ses jalousies

Tu as su renaître de ses cendres
Maintenant tu n'as plus besoin d'elle

Signs, signs are lost
Signs disappeared, turn invisible
Got no sign, somebody got busted
Got a face of stone and a ghostwritten biography
Dogs started rushing in hungry for some food
Dogs start a-twitching and they're looking at you

[Verse 2]
It was light by five
Torn all apart, all in the name of democracy
He's hurt, he's dying
Claimed he was a terrorist, claimed to avert a catastrophe
Someone should've told him that the buck stops here
No one ever said that he was involved with thieves

And they're blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind

Somebody shouts out, says ""What is it? What is it? What is it?""
He was shot down in the night
People ride by but his body's still alive
The girl in the window, what has she done?
She looks down at me, says ""I don't want to die""

And I'm blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind
Blind, blind
Blind, blind, blind, blind, blind

Somebody could have told us where they go
Crawling all around looking for foot, foot, footprints
Now tell me what the hell have we become?
Some dirty little bastards, what the hell is going on?

Don't mention harmony, say ""What is it? What is it? What is it?""

ML1653,Beck,Nobody's Fault But My Own,"[Verse 1]
Treated you like a rusty blade
A throwaway from an open grave
Cut you loose from a chain gang and let you go
And on the day you said it's true
Some love holds, some gets used
Tried to tell you I never knew it could be so sweet

Who could ever be so cruel
Blame the devil for the things you do

[Chorus]
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

[Verse 2]
When the moon is a counterfeit
Better find the one that fits
Better find the one that lights the way for you
When the road is full of nails
Garbage pails and darkened jails
And their tongues are full of heartless tales
That drain on you

Who would ever notice you?
You fade into a shaded room

[Chorus]
It's such a selfish way to lose
The way you lose these wasted blues
These wasted blues

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own

Tell me that it's nobody's fault
Nobody's fault but my own
Tell me that it's nobody's fault

Still by the window pane
Pain like the rain that's falling

In her sad America

When, when was the night so long
Long, like the notes I'm sending

She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America
She waits in the air
Matte kudasai
She sleeps in a chair
In her sad America"
ML1655,Dave Barnes,Family Tree,"Family car we barely fit
Christmas time had come again
Bundled up to fight the freeze
Picking out the family tree

We decorate with clumsy hands
And hope that Santa
Comes again
And the morning wake to see
Gifts beneath the family tree

And I don't know where I'm going
But I do know who I'll be
'Cause memories and names like these all hang
On us the family tree

We're older now
We all have changed
But we all have at the same old things
We'll spend the night with memories
Gathered round the family tree

And I don't where I'm going
But I do know who I'll be
'Cause memories and names like these all hang
On us

We're so much more than blood
We're more than names
We're bound by bonds that only God sustains

But, this time of year
We gather here
And I always know I'm home

There are voices now
Where silence was
The subtle signs of growing up
Where one is born another leaves
Branches on the family tree"

This manger for Your bed
You have a long road before You
Rest Your little head

Can you feel the weight of Your glory
Do You understand the price
Or does the Father guard Your heart for now
So You can sleep tonight

Go to sleep my son
Go and chase Your dreams
This world can wait for one more moment
Go and sleep in peace

I believe the glory of heaven
Is lying in my arms tonight
But Lord I ask that He for just this moment
Simply be my child

Go to sleep my son
Baby close Your eyes
Soon enough You'll save the day
But for now dear child of mine
Oh my Jesus sleep tight"
ML1657,Matt Maher,Empty & Beautiful,"My past won't stop haunting me
In this prison there's a fight between
Who I am and who I used to be

This thorn in my side is a grace
For because of it the flesh and blood of God
Was offered in my place, my place

You fought the fight in me
You chased me down and finished the race
I was blind but now I see
Jesus You kept the faith in me

Where did my best friends go?
In my defense they disappeared
Just like Your friends did to You, oh Lord

But You were there, You gave me strength
So this little one might come to know
The glory of Your name, Your name

You fought the fight in me
You chased me down and finished the race
I was blind but now I see
Jesus You kept the faith in me

Awaiting, set apart like incense to Your heart
A libation I'm pouring out
Empty and beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

You fought the fight in me
You chased me down and finished the race
I was blind but now I see
Jesus You kept the faith in me

You fought the fight in me
You chased me down and finished the race
I was blind but now I see
Jesus You kept the faith in me
Jesus You kept the faith in me
Savior, You kept the faith in me"

ML1660,The Damned Things,Handbook For The Recently Deceased,"[Verse 1]
We're breaking up, getting lost in the static
You're getting blurry right in front of me
The footsteps growing quiet in the hallway
As I let go, let go

The gravity that attracts us helps us implode
Or else we'd keep dividing
But I know, I know

[Chorus]
We're aimed straight at each other
We are doomed to crash
So strike up a fire, light up the town
'Cause we're aimed straight at each other
This was meant to last
So don't try to fight it, the chaos will calm us down

[Verse 2]
Our lips move but we speak in a language
That neither one of us can understand
You sleepwalk through the tape and the sirens
I let go, let go

The rules of our attraction were carved in stone
And yet you keep resisting
But I know, I know

[Chorus]

It doesn't matter, it's a disaster
It doesn't matter
[x2]
The chaos will calm us down

ML1663,Mountain,Theme From An Imaginary Western,"When the wagons leave the city
For the forest and further on
Painted wagon of the morning
Dusty roads where they've gone
Sometimes travelin' through the darkness
At the summer comin' home
Foreign faces by the wayside
Look as if they hadn't known
All the sad was in their eyes
And the desert that's dry
In a country town
Where the map was found
Oh, the dancing and the singing
Oh, the music when they play
Oh, the fire that they saw there
On the grave of no return
Sometimes they found it
Sometimes they kept it
Often lost in on the way
Pawnee shadow to possess him
Sometimes ride inside of day
Oh, the sad was in their eyes
And the desert that's dry
In a country town
Where the map was found
Oh, the sad was in their eye
And the desert that's dry
In a country town
Where the wagons bound"

Nothing stays the same
Everyone will change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in this life
That you can be sure of
Except the rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes, everything will change
'Cause there are not many things in this life
That you can be sure of
Except the rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal

There are not many things in this life
That you can be sure of
Except the rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky

The rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
The rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
And music, sweet music, makes me cry

Everything will change"

Trying to sweat a bunch of fools she done already took
But when that gal gets down you can't help but stare
Cause that frames lit and smoking like a signal flare

She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire

We tried to look away we all tried to be cool
But she had an ass as thick as an army mule's
She asked out for a drink just a batting those eyes
We all was reaching for our wallets man she's a light

She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire
She's on fire

With a smooth proposition she's got you in hand
I hear you say you don't care boy are you a man

She's on fire

She's on fire
She's on fire"
ML1668,Elvis Costello,One Bell Ringing,"[Verse 1]
Rain slapping on a window pane
An hour or two of teeming
Storm punching like a hurricane
That tore him out of dreaming
Air screaming through the slightest gap
Rattling between the frame and the sill
Drapes hanging from the final act
When I had you still

[Chorus]
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood on his lament
Dash him down on the cold cement
One bell ringing

[Verse 2]
Flies buzzing 'round the strip search light
They've got him down on his knees
He dreams of honey dripping from a spoon
Girls whispering in Portuguese
Between the muzzle and the black site
Electrical contact
Deny your name, then carry the blame
Somewhere after the fact

[Chorus]
One lonely bird is singing
Lower the hood of his lament
Dash him down on the cold cement
One bell ringing"

Out there on that bank she lies

There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by
Should you stop?
Better not, much to busy
You'd better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter

Whatever happened to
Saturday Night
When you dressed up sharp
And you felt all right?

It don't seem the same
Since cosmic light
Came into my life
I thought I was divine

I used to go for a ride
With a chick who'd go
And listen to the music
On the radio

A saxophone was blowin'
On a rock 'n' roll show
You climbed in the back seat
Really had a good time

[Chorus]
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

[Break]

[Verse 2]
My head it used to swim
From the perfume I smelt
My hands kinda fumbled with her
White plastic belt

I'd taste her baby-pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine

Get back in front
Put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing
His very last song

With your arms around your girl
You try to sing along
You felt pretty good. Woo!
Really had a good time!

[Chorus]
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock and roll

Hot patootie, bless my soul

I really love that rock and roll

ML1687,Blonde Redhead,Here Sometimes,"A little girl above the fireplace
Only air flying emotionless
Ring the bells for she could keep flying
This is me, completely me

End of day, we watched the sun go down
But I can see, you're like a firework
You wanna save me, people will save me
But this is you, completely you

Now it's day but I am dreaming
A man walks by, I want to be his wife
I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes
Taking my time to go home

Like a candle wasted from burning
I got shoes tired from walking
Calling out your name, my lips keep failing
They have now forgot to sing

Now it's day but I am dreaming
A man walks by, I want to be his wife
I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes
Taking my time to go home

I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only good sometimes
Taking my time to go home

I'm only here sometimes
Under the tree of life
I'm only here sometimes
Taking my time to go home"

A hold on me so dull it kills

I suffocate, I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab

You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain

It's hard for me to say what I want from
You, I have had twenty-two years of
Trying to form the words that somehow
Might mean I am feeling
So many colors in this distraction
Brown hair makes her lips more red
Words would not describe what I'm seeing
I try to hold my tongue but it's useless

She makes my heart scream color
I know by now she should have found me out
And every sense I have's been exhausted
But color makes her smile

She's always waiting for me to speak
But all she hears is whitest noise
Though I may not communicate my heart
She knows the color I'm screaming

She makes my heart scream color
I know by now she should have found me out
And every sense I have's been exhausted
But color makes her smile

No me digas nada, quédate callada
Dices que te vas y te vas y te vas, y aquí estás sentada
Ya me tienes harto, con tantas palabras
No hay necesidad que me cantes lo mismo cada mañana

Cuando quieras irte
Tú pones la fecha pa' despedirte
Yo no tengo pelos para decirte
Que espero que nunca regreses ya

Si te vas, no hay lío
Hay otra que quiere quitarme el frío
Tú ves por tu lado, yo por еl mío
Y así me dejas vivir en paz

Quе no te he querido, que no me has amado
Eso ya no importa, tu cumple con irte y todo arreglado
No tengas pendiente, yo nunca he llorado
Pues, gracias a Dios, en asuntos de amor, soy afortunado

Cuando quieras irte
Tú pones la fecha pa' despedirte
Yo no tengo pelos para decirte

ML1699,Heart,How Can I Refuse,"Wake me up with laughter
Wrap me in your arms
This ain't no morning after
Never been so warm
It didn't take so long
For us to feel this way
Can a good thing last
Longer than a day?

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

I could get addicted
To your energy
The way you take me over
Pulling on me
Our hearts beat together
Our timing is the same
Can I trust my feelings
Save myself the pain?

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

We could share they mystery
Spare ourselves the misery
Discover it again every day
We could take love all the way

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?"

Though I know she likes to be near me

This isn't fantasyland'

It's so sad to say
What we had has gone away
You could say it's sad
Think of what we could have had

I'll let you out without resistance
Parting this way is not the way we ever thought

But we went nowhere quick, so sad it makes me sick

Just one more thing, ok

It's so sad to say
What we had has gone away
You could say it's sad
Think of what we could have had

My animosity has got the best of me
It's been feeding off a sadness deep inside me that'll fade I pray
And in time what will I know
It's so far, it's fading slow

Se ve triste en la cantina a un bohemio ya sin fe
Con los nervios destrozados y llorando sin remedio
Como un loco atormentado por la ingrata que se fue

Se ve siempre acompañado del mejor de los amigos
Que le acompaña y le dice, ya esta bueno de licor
Nada remedia con llanto, nada remedia con vino
Al contrario la recuerda mucho mas tu corazòn

Una noche como un loco mordio la copa de vino
Y de su cortante filo que su boca destroso
Y la sangre que brotaba, confundiose con el vino
Y en la cantina este grito a todos estermeciò

No te apures compañero si me destrozo la boca
No se apure que es que quiero con el filo de esta copa
Borrar la huella de un beso, traicionero que me dio

Mozo... sirvame la copa rota, sirvame que me destroza
Esta fiebre de obsecion
Mozo... sirvame la copa rota
Quiero sangrar gota a gota
El veneno de su amor

Mozo... sirvame la copa rota, sirvame que me destroza
Esta fiebre de obsecion
Mozo... sirvame la copa rota
Quiero sangrar gota a gota, ja ja ja
El veneno de su amor"

I must tramp on through the winter night dreary
Fall asleep, pretty baby, warm on my shoulder

Sleep warm and soft in the arms of your mother
Sleep soft, my darling, my trouble and treasure
Dream of pretty things, dream of your pleasure"

While Abraham shaped your sigh
Never loved you less, never loved you more

A memory is a memory
And a dream is a liar
Was I a man dreaming I was a lamb?
Or am I sleeping in clover tonight?

While men are dreaming
They know it not a dream
Upon waking, we're fools again
What if we're sleeping?

And a dream is a liar
Was I a woman to never see you again?
Or am I dreaming asleep by your side?"

Those beady eyes
The velvet tea cups
The arms on the maps

I'll never know just what i'm doing
I'll never know what is it
I never know what is wrong with you, you know
It feels so bad

The foreign films
The skin and matter
The thoughts on the shelf
The level head
The endless shovel
The fat on the lap
I feel so bad
Yet it seems so right
You point out every mistake and complain every night

I'll never know just what I'm screwing
I'll never know what is it
I never know what is wrong with you, you know
It feels so bad"

Hate and war
The only things we got today

[Verse 1]
And if I close my eyes
It will not go away
You have to deal with it
It is the currency

[Break]
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

[Verse 2]
The hate of a nation
A million miles from home
And get war from the junkies
Who don't like my form
I'm gonna stay in the city
Even when the house fall down
I don't dream of a holiday
When hate and war come around

[Chorus]
Hate and war
The only thing we got today
Hate and war
The only thing

I have no will to survive
I cheat if I can't win
If someone locks me out
I kick my way back in
And if I get aggression
I give it two time back
Every day it's just the same
With hate and war on my back

[Chorus]
Hate and war (I hate English men)
Hate and war (Just as bad as wops)
Hate and war (I hate all the politeness)
Hate and war (I hate all the cops)

Hate and war (Dressed like a creep)
Hate and war (I don't care if I get beat up)
Hate and war (By any rotten Greek)"
ML1717,Bauhaus,The Passion Of Lovers,"[Verse 1]
She had nut-painted arms that were hers to keep
And in her fear, she sought cracked pleasures
""The passion of lovers is for death,"" said she
Licked her lips and turned to feather

[Verse 2]
And as I watched from underneath
I came aware of all that she keeps
The little foxes so safe and sound
They were not dead, they'd gone to ground

[Chorus]
""The passion of lovers is for death,"" said she
The passion of lovers is for death
""The passion of lovers is for death,"" said she
The passion of lovers is for death

[Verse 3]
She breaks her heart just a little too much
And her jokes attract the lucky bad type
When she dips and wails and slips her banshee smile
She gets the better of the bigger to the letter

[Chorus]
""The passion of lovers is for death,"" said she
The passion of lovers is for death
""The passion of lovers is for death,"" said she
The passion of lovers is for death
""The passion of lovers is for death,"" said she
The passion of lovers is for death

For you don't even know their names, no

Some modest means don't leave much way out
In every cradle there's a grave now
In every owner there's a slave now

Heard somewhere that there is a place now
Someone who'll catch you on your way down
But in every captain there's a kid now
In every chaplain there's an id now

So make sure you keep your bunk beds made
One day you'll see your bunker walls degrade
And in every garden there's a snake now
In every pardon there's mistake now

When you fall on the ground
Not a sound, army bound
When you're all no account
No amount, army bound

When your vests or your gowns
Hand-me-down, army bound
When what's next looks unsound
Shaky ground, army bound

Working hard for a round
To the crown, army bound
While you march from your town
To renown, army bound"

Here's a new dance craze that's sweepin' the nation
It's called the Toxic Waltz and it's causin' devastation
You're jumpin' up and down like a psycho circus clown
Slammin' with waltzers all the way around
You get caught up in the whip, you're thrown into a flip
Then you aim for someone's head to stain the floor red
Give someone a kick to prove you're truly sick
Bounce back from some blows and blood runs out your nose

[Pre-Chorus]
Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up, the pit is it
You can take your chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in
There are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit, 'cause they're wimps
And this exercise helps you brutalize
With us, Exodus

[Chorus]
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Kick your friend in the head and have a ball
Come on and do the Toxic Waltz
And slam your partner against the wall
Everybody's doin' the Toxic Waltz
Good friendly, violent fun in store for all
Get up off your ass and Toxic Waltz
If you hit the floor, you can always crawl

[Verse 2]
Used to do the monkey, but now it's not cool
The twist and mashed potato are no exception to the rule
So don't be a dunce and dance like a runt
Just throw your elbows with good friendly, violent fun
Don't start to cry if you get a black eye
Just dive back in and give another try
But too much action may leave you in traction
So you better get insurance no matter your endurance

[Pre-Chorus]
Flailing round and round and you're injury bound
Waltz it up, the pit is it
You can take this chance on this rough new dance
If you dare to dive in
And there are some that try, but they won't survive
They don't hit, 'cause they're wimps
And this exercise helps you brutalize

Get up on your feet, don't look so obsolete
And thrash like an athlete
Don't sit there on your ass, don't look like you got too much class

You are free from the lust for the luster
Of the diamond houses in the city's cluster
From your own ego, from your own blunder

It's funny how the table, how the table turns

[Chorus]
You fake (fake!) your damnation
You pray (pray!) for salvation
'Cause your heart is made of stone
You can die and rot alone

[Verse 2]
I hope you're unhappy and hurting inside
I want you to choke when you swallow your pride
Lay in your coffin and sleep with your sins
Give me the nails and I'll hammer them in
Right now

[Pre-Chorus]
This time you won't be heard
You are gonna burn
It's funny how the table, how the table turns

ML1734,Frankie Ruiz,La Rueda,"[Letra de ""La Rueda""]

[Intro]
¿Qué, qué?
¿Qué, qué?

[Verso 1]
Tú eres la rueda, yo soy el camino
Pasas encima de mi dando vueltas
Tú rodarás, porque ese es tu destino
Sin encontrar nadie que te detenga

[Verso 2]
Quise pararte, pero ibas sin frenos
Y tus rodadas me hicieron pedazos
Porque no quieres los caminos buenos
Y agarras todo lo que hay en tus pasos

[Puente]
¿Qué, qué?
¿Qué, qué?

[Verso 3]
Yo que soñaba con ser en tu vida
El terminar de tus vueltas al mundo
Te vi pasar como nave perdida
De aquí pa' allá sin agarrar tu rumbo

[Verso 4]
Ninguna rueda me había lastimado
Y me pasaron de las más pesadas
Pero contigo quede destrozado
Porque no hiciste ninguna parada

[Pregón 1]
Yo que te tenía siempre a mi lado
Y el día menos pensado tú te me fuiste de mi lado
Pero, ay, que barbaridad (Que barbaridad)
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar
Ninguna mujer a mí me había lastimado
Pero contigo yo quede destrozado
Pero, ay, que barbaridad (Que barbaridad)
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar
Yo que soñaba con ser en tu vida
El terminar de tus vueltas al mundo
Te vi pasar como nave perdida
Pero, ay, que barbaridad
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar
Quise pararte, pero no me escuchabas
Tú te querías ir con él, y de mi lado tú te alejabas
Pero, ay, que barbaridad
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar

[Puente]
Oye negrona, sigue dando vueltas
¿Verdad que no cosigue?
¡Ahí!

[Pregón 2]
Pero, ay, que barbaridad
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar
Yo que a ti te daba todita mi lana
No supiste apreciar, y seguiste con tus rodadas
Pero, ay, que barbaridad (Que barbaridad)
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar
Tú eres la rueda, yo soy el camino
Pasas encima de mí buscando tu destino
Pero, ay, que barbaridad (Que barbaridad)
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar
Te vi pasar como nave perdida
De aquí para allá, sin agarrar tu rumbo; ¡oye, mamá!
Pero, ay, que barbaridad
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar
Pero, ay, que barbaridad, oye que barbaridad
Tú lo perdiste todo, y aquí tú no tienes na'
Pero, ay, que barbaridad
Y yo sin moverme del mismo lugar"
ML1735,Musiq,Girl Next Door ,"[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I would've been nice to you
A little more kind to you
I would've looked twice at you
If I would've knew the girl next door
Would've been you
I probably would've shared my grub
Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 1: Musiq Soulchild]
Girl I'm so surprised to see
The young, fine woman that you grew up to be
Your body's banging like a 400-SE
Even your attitude flows pleasantly
I remember when you was just Tonya Hall
A girl that likes to play basketball
As far as I was concerned, you were one of my boys
I never cared about my sex or yours, but...

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]
If I would've knew the girl next door

Depending on how close we was
By now we would be so in love

[Verse 2: Musiq Soulchild]
I'm happy to see that you're home from school
And I wanna let you know that I'm proud of you
Even when we was younger, I admired you
That's why I used to always pick fights with you
I remember when we used to call each other names
Mimic old tv shows and play those childish games
Like I was your Tarzan and you were my Jane
Can we do that nowadays?

[Hook: Musiq Soulchild]

If I would've knew the boy next door would've been you
I would've been nice to you
Spent a little time with you
I would've dressed cuter too
If I would've knew the boy next door
Would've been you
I would've been on your team
When we played hide and seek
Instead of you chasing me

[Bridge: Ayana (& Musiq Soulchild)]
You're so fly now
(Girl stop playing)
I didn't know you were that guy now
(Naw I ain't)
Phat car, phat life
Impressed I am
Oh maybe we could jam like we used to baby

The glamour boys swear they are a diva
The glamour boys have it all under control
Always dancing, always laughing
The glamour boys are playing the role

The glamour boys never have no money
The glamour boys wear the most expensive clothes
The glamour boys are always at the party
Where the money comes from heaven only knows

[Chorus]
I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)
I ain't no glamour boy (Whoo!)
I ain't no glamour boy (I'm fierce!)

[Verse 3]
The glamour boys live off their ambition
The glamour boys have it all figured out
A very, very dubious position
When you got no clout

The glamour boys' whole life is a gamble
They might get over or fall flat on their face
But if one does, there's no need to worry
Another G-Boy will take his place

The glamour boys just need tonight to play
But just like things you can't afford on credit
Time catches up and you have to pay

You'll always find them in the hottest spots in town
They'll be your friend if you have fame or fortune
If you don't they won't be hanging 'round

ML1739,Norah Jones,The Long Way Home,"Well, I stumbled in the darkness
I'm lost and alone
Though I said I'd go before us
And show the way back home
Is there a light up ahead?
I can't hold on very long
Forgive me, pretty baby
But I always take the long way home

Money's just something you throw
Off the back of a train
I got a head full of lightning
And a hat full of rain
And I know that I said
I'd never do it again
Oh and I love you, sweet baby
But I always take the long way home

I put food on the table
And a roof overhead
But I'd trade it all tomorrow
For the highway instead
Watch your back, if I should tell you
Love's the only thing I've ever known
One thing for sure, sweet baby
I always take the long way home

You know I love you, baby
More than the whole wide world
I'm your woman
You know you are my pearl
So let's go out past the party lights
Where we can finally be alone
Come with me
And we can take the long way home

Come with me
Together we can take the long way home
Come with me
Together we can take the long way home"

Orange yellow and black flesh trees bloom fire fire fire
I'm trapped inside this motel 6 on fire, fire, fire
Those young fists clenched in the air
Make a million millionaires
Set fire to the ships on fire!
Set fire to the hips on fire!

Constellations strung up like barbed wire, wire, wire
I'm drinking cement like it's going out of style, style, style
Those cold hooks, cemetery claws
Raking out the infants' jaws
Set fire to the horse on fire!
Set fire to the dress on fire!
Set fire to the stage on fire!
Set fire to the stars on fire!

Now I'm tied to a seagull's back, yeah, fire, fire, fire
And all those black-haired bandits try to lure me down with their songs and choir, choir, choir
But I'd rather shoot up a syringe filled with fire, fire, fire
Than go to bed with sounds so vacant and tired, tired, tired

What's the sound of a cashing check?
What's the sound of a gag reflex?
Like speakers crushed beneath an empty tank
Blowing the ugly off an airbrushed face

Set fire to the drums on fire!
Set fire to the lions on fire!
Set fire to the house on fire!
Set fire to the face on fire!"

The world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel

The circus tent was strung
With every star in the sky
Above the ring I loved so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the tinsel and gold

Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl, you're through
Sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky, little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl
You may as well surrender
Your hope is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy
To cheer little girl blue?

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begun

Cites burn in flames
Only ruins remain
Blood stains the earth
Defenders fight in vain
Crushing all before them
With metal armoured might
Futile prayers for mercy
Unanswered in the fight

Signed in blood
A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence
Armoured assault has begun

Locked in bitter conflict
Leg devastation begin
The iron fist of evil
Condemns you and your kin
Destruction of subhuman race
Innocents shall die
The plague of war corrupts the earth
They’re fighting for a lie

A pact is made
Destruction and murder has come
With blistering pace
Let battle commence

It is I who hopes to bring light
To this valley of death
Behind the shadow of lies

Brilliant beams converge now to blind me
I cannot feel shame nor regret
But in the presence of death
When the vultures arrive

Slaves, your time of descent will come with us all
Pain the way of all flesh that withers to old

All that you dream will be forgotten
And burn with the kindred of souls
I am the seed who has begotten
To rot with the waste of this earth down below
Now burn with the kindred of souls
Your hopes have now aged and withered away

All that you dream will be forgotten
And burn with the kindred of souls
I am the seed who has begotten
To rot with the waste of this earth down below"

Because the blues has done spread
Rocks in my bed

Of all the people I see
Why do they pick on poor me
And put rocks in my bed

So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed

There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
That's a deceitful woman
And a hard faced man

She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She's lower than a snake down in a wagon track

So hold your head and hold your tongue
But only say what you have to
And as a child, yes, I dreamed
Of holding her in the silver screen
She loved her man but loved him twice
I wish I'd been that passenger
Having fun, fly my kite
The devil inside won't control my life
And too much love, so little hate
The devil inside won't control my fate

[Chorus]
Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with
Instead of bombing our neighbours, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
So here I go to see the world
With my eyes and with my soul
And too much love, so little hate
The devil inside won't control my fate

Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with
Instead of bombing our neighbours, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
So hold your head and run my time
The what of life no man can rhyme
So here we are and here we bleed
To be a victim, there's no need
Having fun, I never fight
The devil inside controls my life
Too much love so little hate
The devil inside will control my fate

Oh, if only, if only
Oh, he wasn't so lonely
He'd have someone to play with

Is what I fear

Crush down all you fear

Eliminate the opposite
Make enemies and friends your slaves

A crime is just a crime if you get sentenced for it

Its actors my puppets
Slaves of the state

I write the tragedy
Everybody obeys my will

Nobody wins

Sorrow is my profit
Finally death is what I sell
Hate is my business and I create your hell

La tarde esta en su lugar
Hoy el cielo se viste de añil
Sin rumbo voy por la cuidad
Esta isla esta llena de ti
Arena y mar sol tropical
Y tú, tú no estas aquí
La radio esta tocando ya
Aquella canción que habla de ti
Tal vez me quede en un bar
A ver la noche llegar

San Juan sin ti
Es un espejismo desde que no estas aquí
San Juan sin ti
Ya no se que pensar
Ya no se donde ir

San Juan sin ti
Ya no es lo mismo
Te necesito junto a mi

Todo me sale mal
Esta isla esta llena de ti

[Verso 1]
Amanecer con él
A mi costado no es igual que estar contigo
No es que esté mal, ni hablar
Pero le falta madurar, es casi un niño
Blanco como el yogur
Sin ese toro que tú llevas en el pecho
Fragilidad de flor
Nada que ver con mi perverso favorito

[Pre-Coro]
Sin tus uñas arañándome la espalda
Sin tus manos que me estrujan, todo cambia
Sin tu lengua envenenando mi garganta
Sin tus dientes que torturan y endulzan, yo no siento nada

[Coro]
Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambrosía salpicada de ""te quieros""
Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
Es como no hacer nada, falta fuego en la mirada
Falta dar el alma en cada beso
Y sentir que puedes alcanzar el cielo

[Verso 2]
Quise olvidarte con él
Quise vengar todas tus infidelidades
Y me salió tan mal
Que hasta me cuesta respirar su mismo aire

[Pre-Coro]
Los mechones de tu pelo negro crespo
Tus caderas afiladas y escurridas
Esa barba que raspaba como lija
Y tu sonrisa retorcida son lo mejor que hay en mi vida

[Coro]
Hacer el amor con otro, no, no, no
No es la misma cosa, no hay estrellas de color rosa
No destilan los poros del cuerpo
Ambrosía salpicada de ""te quieros""

Falta dar el alma en cada beso

You best believe I'll keep singing until I make my wrongs so right
Devil said, a pity for your troubles to take your tired old soul
So you know you got to go

Hurry, to catch the morning
You got to hurry on now
In the night
I would heed my sorrow
And it knows, won't be long now
Hurry

Now with blind hands, I crawl this lonely place
As my dry tears fall and roll away
I can't see troubles as they dance behind my back
Ooo, sorrow is my soul to slay

He stole my sorrows from the morning; he ripped them from the night
And you best believe I'll keep singing to make my wrongs so right
Devil took a pity of my troubles; he holds my tired old soul

Makes that rosin burn

But he can't wait until they turn that bull outside

They call me Stacey (And now it's in my mind)
They call me ""her"" (Call a preacher, get some words)
They call me Jane (And get some time in)
That's not my name (And though I realised)
That's not my name (I cannot emphasise)
That's not my name (Sittin' 'round with just a promise)
That's not my name (Nothing binding)
(So alone all the time and I lock myself away)
They call me quiet (However, can't you see?) (Are you calling me ""bird""?)
But I'm a riot (Living so desperately)
Mary, Jo, Lisa (A standing joke)
Always the same (That I provoke a one-liner)
(Though I'm dressed up, out and all)
That's not my name (Instead of sing-a-long)
That's not my name (This song is monotone)
(With everything considered, they forget my name)
That's not my name (I gotta get some soul)
That's not my name (I gotta get some feeling)

[Outro: Jules De Martino]
First, it was in my head and now it's in my mind
Call a preacher, get some words and get some time in
And though I realised I cannot emphasise
Sittin' 'round with just a promise, nothing binding
However, can't you see? Living so desperately
A standing joke that I provoke a one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long, this song is monotone
I gotta get some soul, I gotta get some feeling"

Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun

Only you can cool my desire

ML1783,Crocodiles,All My Hate And My Hexes Are For You,"My burning hate at sight
It first seems so insane like a vagrant in the rain
But your face at night
Drills a tick-tock in my brain, digs canals across my face

When I hold the fury of the world
All the eyes of little girls will be flames that dance and swirl
And they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone
And when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air
I'll be there

No love to spend on you
I can piss away my cash, my time I can't get back
And your face at night
Dances tick-tock on my brain, digs it's digits in my face

When I hold the fury of the world
All the eyes of little girls will be flames that dance and swirl
And they'll melt you to your bones, char your eyes turn you to stone
And when the future finds you there and they stack you in the air
I'll be there to burn down that skyscraper too

Habit alone, when separate I moan
Feeding on bones or anything grown
I command post and nobody shows
In mornings I rest here
In evenings I work here
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left
All I adore...

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

[Verse 2]
I work alone saving my soul
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face
My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion
Spellwork and lies!

[Chorus]
You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire"

ML1791,Eric Benet,Hurricane,"[Verse 1]
Standing here in disarray
A calm serenity
The winds of change can devastate
And it took this much for me
With nowhere to run and no reason left to hide
Gonna hold on
All the walls around are broken down
Now I can hear the rising sun

Surrounded by everything I want
But nothing that I need
I was blinded by the absurdities
Losing all identity
Sometimes what you fear the most is what you need
To find that road
Right around that curve a lesson learned
Now that I have the eyes to see

[Chorus]
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again

[Verse 2]
With poison toys I'd isolate
But the wind was strong and true
But now I see where the treasure is
'Cause they only blocked my view
I'm spiraling down but so oblivious
Got to find my way home
There's a heart that bleeds trapped in me
But how do I break this shell of stone?

[Chorus]
A hurricane, a hurricane, yeah
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain
A hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane
Is sometimes the only thing that brings you back again, yeah

[Bridge]
Sometimes I cried (Sometimes I cried)
But tears wouldn't fall
And sometimes I tried (Sometimes I tried)
To break those walls and feel your love
But I came alive inside
When I finally found my way

Ooh, a hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane
Is sometimes the only way to wash away the pain, yeah
A hurricane (A hurricane), a hurricane
Sometimes the only thing that brings you back again, oh-oh-oh

Uncle lied and I could die and I said something new
Would you like the things I saw and bring you too
I should tell me more I'd like to see me I know where I would

Parties like my policy and I take where I'm some
Damaged like my every thoughts and when you talk I do
Things I did when I was dead and everyone loves you

Oooooooooooh"
ML1794,The Raveonettes,Evil Seeds,"When you're here
I long for all those things
My eyes would steal like a thief and hide from you

When it rains
On this town and in this heart
I betray the ones I've come to love the most

When I'm down
And most of all I've had
Has come to get revenge on all I've done

But I'm sad

And our love is far behind
I long for all that time I spent with you

When I'm gone
Like a raven in the grave
Young lovers sure won't spring from these evil seeds

Play with fire
Play with you sometimes"

Lost inside ourselves and blindly staring at the sun
So lonely, is this what we've become?

Not sure who's coming next

Cuando aquí en los míos hay un mar entero de carias nuevas
Que guarde para ti
Cada madrugada es un frío invierno
Que me quema lento
Abrazo a mi almohada creyendo tenerte
Es un tormento cruel
Por que al amanecer se me antoja tu piel
Y si tu supieras cuanto te amo chiquitita
Y puros primos de Durango oiga

ML1804,Raheem DeVaughn,Nobody Wins A War ,"No one will win the war, see families only die
And birds won't soar the sky and there'll be no sun to shine
No country wins a war, the grass won't grow the same
The moon won't shine at night and there's a losing fight
Nobody wins a war

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a rocket was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring?

No soldier wins a war, see soldiers only die
And mamas only cry just for a conscious flag to fly
That's why nobody wins a war, no war is worth your life
See that's a priceless pride, no war is worth your blood
Nobody wins a war

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a rocket was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
Tell me who would you pray to?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring
If you heard a bomb was headed your way?

Now what would you do, what would you say
If you heard a rocket was headed your way?
Where would you go, what would you bring?
No one wins a war

No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war
No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war

No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war
No one wins a war, no one wins
No one wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war
Nobody wins a war, nobody wins a war

Nobody wins a war
We, the people speak, speak
We want to be free of this sick bureaucracy
No more death tolls with our morning coffee
Oh, government, you have lost your feeling for life

It is war that you reap
But the loss is too great and the pain is too deep
The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak

Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak

Your lies are your destruction, your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal, you are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow, your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage, it rots and it reeks

Of death in the wind, the foul stench of men
Basking in their cruelty, rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride, you risk all of humanity

You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know, people they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace

But there is always a possibility for peace
As un-perfect as we are, we should in all ways reach
Deep, deep down in our beings
Oh, this wicked, wicked system of things

As our grandmothers say
Will soon be no more, will soon be no more
Because nobody, no one ever wins a war"
ML1805,Unwritten Law,Save Me,"[Verse 1]
Had a bad day, don't talk to me
I'm gonna ride this out
My little black heart breaks apart
With your big mouth, and
I'm sick of my sickness
Don't touch me, you'll get this
I'm useless, lazy
Perverted, and you hate me

[Chorus]
You can't save me
You can't change me
Well, I'm waiting for my wake up call
And everything, everything's my fault

Went to the doctor, and I asked her
To make this stop (Whoa-oh)
Got medication, a new addiction
Fuckin' thanks a lot (Whoa-oh)
Had a relapse, I'm bad at rehabs
It ruins everything (Whoa-oh)
So point your finger at the singer
He's in the pharmacy

You can't save me
You can't change me

You can't save me
You can't blame me
Well, I'm waiting here to take the fall
And everything, everything's my fault

[Bridge]
And I'm a death threat, haven't slept yet
Baby, why the wake up call?
I'm the bad boy, tell the tabloids
Everything's my fault
Whoa-oh-whoa, whoa-oh, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, write it, write it
Whoa-oh-whoa, whoa-oh, oh, oh
Everything's my fault
Everything's my fault

[Verse 3]
I went to heaven, I couldn't get in
For what I have done
I said, ""Please take me,"" they said, ""You're crazy
You had too much fun""

[Chorus]
You can't save me
You can't change me
Well, I'm waiting for my wake up call
Everything's my fault
You can't save me
You can't blame me
Well, I'm waiting here to take the fall
Everything, everything's my fault

[Outro]
You can't save me
You can't change me
(Everything's my fault)
You can't save me
You can't change me

You can't change me

ML1806,Gwar,A Gathering Of Ghouls,"[Verse 1]
We came from your nightmares
And we're calling for your souls
Your endless death begins today
The Bloody Pit has final say
The Bloody Pit, the bloody war
The only bloody way

The Bloody Pit of Horror
It feed on endless souls
The carnage must be unimpeded
Blood and souls are what is needed
The killing goes on day and night
We'll never fill this hole

The Bloody Pit, it doesn't care
About the why, the when, the where
As guts are ripped and blood is spilled
It only knows it must be filled
And that's the way its always been
Never change, never win

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's make it clear
Just why we're here
It's for something more important
Thank for drinking all your beer
We're here to kill you
And claim your souls
And drape your stinking entrails round
Our numerous war-poles

[Chorus]
Can't be called a crime
Happens every time
A gathering of ghouls
We fill the pit with blood and souls
This is the only rule
Zombies marching off to war
They've done it all before
A gathering of ghouls
Raping, slaying, heavily flaying
The Bloody Pit is pleased!
It's bursting with disease
A gathering of ghouls
Hacking and bashing
And selling drugs at school

[Breakdown]
They say that this world is going insane
But I care little, my zombies need brains
If we need more victims, we'll load them in trains

All is as it was and will be lots more
The Bloody Pit of Horror
The bloody curse of war"
ML1807,BarlowGirl,Stay With Me,"Hopeless, getting through this night
And life is not dying in this fight
I'm begging you to deliver me ooh ooh ooh
Confused why you won't take this pain from me

My steps never felt so hard
The end never look so far but
If you won't take me out
Then please take me through this

Stay with me so I won't leave
And make me see that this is not forever
'Cause all I need is your love pulling me

What is the reason for this night
Is hope found in fullness with no light
Does strength grow in our greatest fears
God I pray something good will come from this pain

With you here I know
I don't go alone
I am yours and so
Through the fire I'll go"

My favourite foremost coastal Antarctic shelf

Oh I, I think it's over again
Like sawblades through the air
Your winter overture
Cut through everything, and now we're not so sure
Oh Larsen B, oh won't you fall on me?

You had twelve thousand years
And now it's all over
Five hundred billion tonnes of the purest pack ice and snow
Oh Larsen B, oh won't you fall on me?
Oh Larsen B, desalinate the barren sea

Oh I, think it's the start of the end
Like sawblades through the air
Your winter overture

ML1813,Belle & Sebastian,The Ghost Of Rockschool,"I've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
But it all disappears and then I wake up

Was it too late? Was it just your fate?
There's a demon that waits at the garden gate
If you get past him, maybe Lawrence and Phil
Will be waiting to take you to the ghost of rockschool

Everything hums as the blue heart turns
And the blue girl's dawn is when the sun goes down
My story tonight is from your solitude heights
I got a window on your constellation

Master I love from the ground above
As the stars below, as my memory flows
Every picture frame is beating louder than time
Every clock in the hall is bending slowly

She's in her tower and she's beautiful, sure
The quicker you learn she has no soul to discern
At least no business of yours, you bear the vacuum of scars
She was put there to tempt you like the perfume of flowers

I've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in my dreams and the free ride of grace
I've seen God shining out from her reflection

I've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in the puddles and the lane beside houses
I've seen God shining out from her reflection

I've seen God in the sun, I've seen God in the street
God before bed and the promise of sleep
God in the puddles and the lane beside houses
I've seen God shining out from her reflection"

We come and we go, a-weeping and a-wailing
Our heads in the hands of the nurse
Well, put your head on my shoulder, baby, tell me where it hurts
You say you lost your one and only, could it get any worse?
I say death is just a door, you'll be reunited on the other side

And the tulip trees are blooming

In the meadow cows are sleeping
And the speckled trouts stop leaping upstream as we dream

A far pink cloud hangs over a hill
Unfolding like a rose
If you hold my hand and sit real still
You can hear the grass as it grows

And there's no one passing by it to see
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me
Come spend this lazy afternoon with me

No, I'm just tired

[Verse 3]
And on a swing you push me hard
So I'll come back to where you are
And you know I'm never far
No decisions, nothing hard

[Bridge]
And I knew that it would rain tonight
I'll take the bus or the next flight
I won't give up on what feels right

[Chorus]
If you see these tears filling my eyes
It's just the wind that makes me cry
If you could feel this pain inside
It's from the drinks we drank last night
It's from the drinks we drank last night

[Verse 4]
And the shadow of our past
Projects on clouds of dust and gas
Wounds where my eyes will rest
The silhouette of loneliness

[Chorus]
If you see these tears filling my eyes
It's just the wind that makes me cry
If you could feel this pain inside
It's from the drinks we drank last night
It's from the drinks we drank last night"
ML1823,The Flaming Lips,The Sparrow Looks Up At The Machine,"What
What does it mean?
To dream what you dream
To believe what you see

Why
Why do we fear
To try to fly near
Underneath the machine

What
What does it mean?
To dream what you dream
To believe what you see

Why
Why do we fear
To try to fly near
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machine
Just beneath the machine"
ML1824,Alkaline Trio,Time To Waste,"There's someone down below blowing you a kiss
They watch from their windows
As all arms fall to their sides, and all eyes fix
On the death of tomorrow

And you found everything you need
To make a life complete
Completely revolting, and they have safety and relief
For sale up the street
I see you in line everyday

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill, it's dead and buried
You've got guts to spill, but no one trustworthy

These creatures are waking up in these dark trees
Waiting like vultures
Eyes roll back, turn white in time to feed
They salivate in hunger

For you and everything they need
To make a death complete
Completely unnatural and salvation lies
Behind those dead eyes
That watch you while you sleep every night

And you had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy

You had time to waste and I'm not sorry
Such a basket case, hide the cutlery
I had time to kill its dead and buried
You've got guts to spill but no one trustworthy"
ML1825,Marc Anthony,Hasta Que Vuelvas Conmigo ,"[Verse 1]
Porque andas creyendo en otros
Esos que no quieren verme, a tu lado y sin razón de ser
Que andan diciendo mentiras
Para poder separarnos y arruinar este querer
Porque andas creyendo en otros
Y perdiendo tu confianza, esa que recupere una vez
Mis errores fueron pocos, tus perdones fueron muchos
Nunca quise serte infiel

[Chorus]
Hasta que vuelvas conmigo, no daré la media vuelta
Hasta que tu te des cuenta que la vida doy contigo
Que también te equivocaste, el culpable es el cariño
Hasta que vuelvas conmigo, no daré la media vuelta
Hasta que tu te des cuenta que este corazón herido
No querrá sentir las horas…., cuando sepa que te has ido

[Verse 2]
Porque andas creyendo en otros, es que acaso mis palabras
Son amargas en tu boca y en tu miel
Ponle crédito a la angustia, ponle peso a la balanza
Muéstrame lo que es el placer

[Chorus]

Hasta que vuelvas conmigo no me daré por vencido

Hasta que vuelvas conmigo, yo no descansaré
Aquí esperando siempre estaré

[Verse 3]
Hasta que vuelvas conmigo no me daré por vencido
Y no te dejare, no te dejare yo no me daré por vencido mujer
Hasta que vuelvas conmigo

Hasta que vuelvas conmigo no me daré por vencido

[Verse 4]
Desde el dia en que te vi, caminando por la plaza
Y me diste esa mirada, no sabia lo que pasaba
Hasta el cuerpo me temblaba, me dejaste sin palabras
Me dijiste que en mi estaba, ese amor que tu soñabas
Aquel dia te entregue todo de mi, y mira como me pagas

[Outro]
Yo te lo dije mamacita

Yo te lo dije mamacita

When you were holding
Another girl tight

'Cause my specs give me perfect sight

Everything becomes delightful
I'm not afraid of the dark or noise
I'm not daunted by the bark of boys
I'm with the birds flying in blue skies
Feathery free and I'm feeling fine
This city is a golden gate
The kind of gold that I love to hate
How good it gets in the hype and stress
Even though it's all a well-lit mess
Bury, bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Hurry, bury me up to my knees
I'll swing my branches better in the breeze

Mental mammoth, I know I have a very bad habit
Of filling up my cup halfway elephantasizing my eyes
Vision still untrained in seeing what I have gained
A simple remedy of walking into trees
Mistaking birds as bees
Mistaking things I see

Bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Bury, bury, better plant it in the ground
True or false with the lost and found
Hurry bury me over my head
Level with the living, level with the dead
Bury, bury better plant your feet down
The true and false of your lost and found"

All we want is to sleep together

Were only after one thing (6x)

All these ruptures in etiquette
All this confident decadence

All we want is to be together

Sick in the car seat, 'cause you're not up to going

ML1846,Raul Malo,You're Only Lonely,"When the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely
Now don't you ever be ashamed
You're only lonely
When you need someone around
On the nights that try you
I was there when you were a Queen
And I'll be the last one there beside you
So you can call out me name
When you're only lonely
No don't you ever be ashamed
You're only lonely

Ohh....
When the world is ready to fall
On your little shoulders
And when you're feeling lonely and small
You need somebody there to hold you
You can call out my name
When you're only lonely
It's no crime, Darlin', we've got lots of time
Wooow...oohh...
Babe, there's nothing wrong with you
Darlin' I get lonely too
You're only lonely (only lonely)
So if you need me
All you gotta do is call me
Please call on me...
You're only lonely"

Con el atardecer
Me iré de ti, me iré sin ti
Me alejare de aqui
Con un dolor, dentro de mi

[Pre-Coro 1]
Te juro corazón
Que no es falta de amor
Pero es mejor así
Un día comprenderás
Que lo hice por tu bien
Que todo fue por ti

[Coro]
La barca en que me iré
Lleva una cruz de olvido;
Lleva una cruz de amor
Y en esa cruz sin ti
Me moriré de hastío
La barca en que me iré
Lleva una cruz de olvido;
Lleva una cruz de amor
Y en esa cruz sin ti
Me moriré de hastío

Culpable no he de ser
De que por mí puedas llorar
Mejor sera partir
Prefiero así que hacerte mal

Mi nave cruzará un mar de soledad
Adiós, adiós mi amor
Recuerda que te amé
Que siempre te he de amar

ML1852,The Smiths,Meat Is Murder,"[Intro]
*sawing machines and cow groans*

[Verse 1]
Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

[Verse 2]
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood
And the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No, no, no, it is murder
No, no, no, it is murder
Oh, and who hears when animals cry?

[Outro]
*sawing machines and cow groans*"

Signs don't show
You drove me
Off the road

But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?
You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move, move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs

[Pre-Chorus]
But you let go
'Cause your hope is gone
And every answer fades away

[Chorus]
It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?
You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistake

Wipe the mud spray from your face
Stop the engine, stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face
Stop the engine, yeah, stop pretending
That you're still breathing

Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off?
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistake"

You closed your eyes and said, ""I'm feeling torn""
How could I be so unendingly forced into this course

Sad, I feel sad
For you, so sad
You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding
From the heart, when he doesn't come home

Another broken promise tips the scale and it goes pale
He sings shifting from side to side
Can't make up his god-given mind, no
Why don't you just go
If she's waiting

Sad, I feel sad
For you, so sad
You'll be left alone, and broken bleeding
From the heart, when he doesn't come home

Rolling out tears like a wave

But she'll never be his slave

Playing every single card that's dealt to me
You know some days are aces and some days are faces
Well some days are twos and threes

So you gotta fight, fight, fight, fight all the way

Lambs to the slaughter, certain death awaits
Trapped on a field littered with bones
Nations of falling lying below

Now you march forward to die
Ten million bodies piled high
Mechanized engines of war spitting lead
Horrors of battle fill you with dread
Bombs are falling, death is calling
Fire raining from the sky
Blown to bits by a hail of lead
Fall without a reason why

Call upon gods of death
Fight! Awaken all your rage
Launch the attack, no turning back
Charge! Your destiny awaits
The order is given, over the top
Scream, for you it is too late

We'll give you what you've been waiting for
Total war

Bombs are falling, death is calling
Fire raining from the sky
Blown to bits by a hail of lead

The order is given, over the top
Scream, for you it is too late

We'll give you what you've been waiting for
Total war

Not ready to die, though your time will come tonight
Total war

Total war
All the life that was in you, now is gone
Total war
The battle's over but the war rages on

Through the pines, through the briars
And down to the briny sea
Let it fall on the fields and the haystack
On the eye of a flea on a bear's back

So take your earplugs out
Hear what the birds have to say
They've been tryin', they've been tryin'
And they are tired today
And they're waiting around for a wind
Sick of waiting around for a wind

Up at Lookout Point
And down at Makeout Creek
Lovers lyin' in the pine
And they're off their guards, asleep
And they're waiting around for a sign
Sick of waiting around for a sign

Having handsome bite buxom

No one would know
Talking about stealing the show
When they're all letting go
Take a look at the witch
See the twitch in her eye
Tell me, what does she feel?
Is this the weight of the world?
Take a boy and a girl
Show them lying is real

But then I see the edge, I look, I fall
And I get deeper and deeper
The more I see, the more I fall
No place to hide, I better take the call
I get deeper and deeper

Was it the smell of the oil
Or the sweat and the toil
That made the living unreal?
Was it the man in the suit
Or the one with a flute?
Tell me, what did he steal?
Is it beginning to break?
Can you see the mistake?
They'll be nowhere to go
Was it a fool's blood
In the wrong neighborhood?
What price does he pay?

But then I see the edge, I look, I fall
I get deeper and deeper
The more I see, the more I fall
No place to hide, I better take the call
I get deeper and deeper

Tell me, what do I say?

But you're my angel baby
Yes, you're my angel baby
Whoa, you're my angel baby
For the rest of the night

Do you remember how it used to be?
Loving was easier when you were loving me
I guess you found someone and now I find

What's breaking is my heart
You've got leaving on your mind

But you're my angel baby
Yes, you're my angel baby
Oh, you're my angel baby
For the rest of the night

What's breaking is my heart
I can read between the lines
It's tearing me apart
You've got leaving on your mind

But you're my angel baby
For the rest of the night (Angel baby)
The rest of the night (Angel baby)

ML1869,Jeffrey Osborne,Don't You Get So Mad,"[Verse 1:]
We were having such a good time, baby
Oh, yes, we were
Then you went and spoiled the whole thing, baby
In front of everyone

You're telling me I was wrong
And that all night long
I was staring at somebody else
Well, even if you were right
There's no need to fight
There's no need to get upset

[Chorus:]
Don't you get so mad about it
(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad about it
(About it, about it)
Don't you get so mad about it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't you get so mad about it, hey
(Mad about it)

[Verse 2:]
You should learn to control your feelings
Respectably
‘Cause arguing in public is embarrassing

It's always the same thing, baby
Accusing me out of jealousy
I never will understand
Why you make so much out of such a little thing

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
It's all so crazy now
Somehow it's got to change
Take a look at yourself
Carrying on this way

I know you care about
The love we're building here
So why get all upset
It's just not worth it
Listen to me, my dear

[Repeat Chorus:]

(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't you get so mad, baby
(About it, about it)
Whoa, whoa, ho, baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't you get so mad about it
(Mad about it)
Whoa, ho, oh…

(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't get so mad now, baby
(About it, about it)
Ho, don't you get so mad about it, babe
Don't you get so mad
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't you get so mad about it, babe, no
(Mad about it)
Woo, ooh, ho

(Do you have to get so mad)
Don't get so mad about it
(About it, about it)
There's no need to get upset
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Darling, please don't forget the love we had
(Mad about it)
Oh…"
ML1870,Ann & Nancy Wilson,Blue Christmas,"I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas"
ML1871,ZZ Top,Arrested For Driving While Blind,"[Verse 1]
When you're driving
Down the highway at night
And you're feeling that wild turkey's bite
Don't give Johnny Walker a ride
'Cause Jack Black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind

[Verse 2]
Now just the other night with nothing to do
We broke a case of proof 102
And started itching for that wonderful feel
Of rolling in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind
And let me tell you we were flying while blind

[Instrumental Break 0:47-1:29]

[Verse 3]
Then they had us up against the wall
Hey, it's only blood grain alcohol
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind
To arrest a man for driving while blind?

[Verso 1]
El amor es una gota de agua en un cristal
Es un paseo largo sin hablar
Es una fruta para dos
El amor es un espacio en donde no hay lugar
Para otra cosa que no sea amar
Es algo entre tú y yo

[Coro]
El amor es llorar cuando nos dice adiós
El amor es soñar oyendo una canción
El amor es besar poniendo el corazón
Es perdonarme tú y comprenderte yo
El amor es parar el tiempo en un reloj
Es buscar un lugar donde escuchar tu voz
El amor es crear un mundo entre los dos
Es perdonarme tú y comprenderte yo

[Verso 2]
El amor es una gota con sabor a miel
Es una lluvia en el atardecer
Es un paraguas para dos
El amor es un espacio donde no hay lugar
Para otra cosa que no sea amar
Es algo entre tú y yo

El amor es llorar cuando nos dice adiós

Just inside my door

As it always has before

There's just one lonely present
Beneath my Christmas tree
'Cause the best little present a girl ever had
Has gone away from me

Oh, my Christmas tree is not very big
In fact it's kind of small
Honey went, he picked 'em out
They always seem so tall

The lights don't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my Christmas bright
Is gone away from me

I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All I want for Christmas is
My baby back at home

Oh, my Christmas tree's so sad and bare
My room's so big and cold
They wish me happy new year
But the new year is already on

There's no little angel
On top where it used to be
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me..."

Eramos nosotros cuatro y con el
Cinco locos

Cuantas noches llorando cantamos
Que noches aquellas
Hasta hicimos llorar a la luna
Contando de penas

Pero en el camino
Donde pasamos los últimos anos
De nuestra vida
Un día se marcho
Sin decirnos adiós
Juguetón como siempre se marcho
Simplemente
En el polvo de un rayo de sol
Que atardecía

Yo le quisiera mandar a decir
Que si las almas cantan canciones
Que si en el cielo tienen guitarras
Para cantarles a los amores
Y si el me manda a decir que si
Que nos separe cuatro lugares
Porque algún día cuando no se
Volveremos a ser cuatro locos y el
Otra vez cinco"

Burn it away get fucking paid now

The answering
To every prayer I've prayed
She's coming home this Christmas Day

So tell me Christmas
Are we kind more this day than any other day?
Or is it only in our minds?
And must it leave when you have gone away?
It's different now
It's changed somehow
And now you're here to stay
She's coming home this Christmas Day

All at once the world
It doesn't seem the same
And in a single night
You know it all has changed

I have the ornament
I have the perfect tree
I have a string of lights
I have a chance to see
Everything that my heart thought could be

[Verse 4]
For of all the dreams
You were the first I knew
And every other one
Was a charade of you
You stayed close when I was far away
In the darkest night
You always were the star
You always took us in
No matter who we are
And so she's coming home this Christmas Day

I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than lonely room of mine
Through a lonely night a waitin' for another place, another time

And the lowly beasts around Him stood
Jesus our King, kind and good
I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown
I carried His mother up and down
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town
I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown
I, said the ox, This was my hay
I gave Him my manger, it was here that He lay
I gave Him my manger, it was here that He lay
I, said the ox, This was my hay
I said the sheep with pearly horn
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn
I, said the sheep with pearly horn
I, said the dove, from the rafters high
I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep, my love and I
I, said the dove, from the rafters high

In the stable dark, was glad to tell
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel"

And let the gentleman do his thing

Owes you something
'Cause you're here

You're goin' out
The world backwards
Like you did
When you first come here

Keep talkin' 'bout the president
Won't stop air pollution
Put your hand on your mouth
When you cough, that'll help the solution

Oh, you cuss around women folk
And you don't even know their names
And you're dumb enough to think
That'll make you a big ol' man

Respect yourself, respect yourself
If you don't respect yourself
Ain't nobody gonna give a good cahoot, na, na, na, na
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Respect yourself, respect yourself"
ML1899,Dashboard Confessional,Vindicated,"[Verse 1]
Hope dangles on a string
Like slow-spinning redemption
Winding in, and winding out
The shine of it has caught my eye

And roped me in so mesmerizing
So hypnotizing
I am captivated
I am

[Chorus]
Vindicated, I am selfish, I am wrong
I am right, I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
The things you swore you saw yourself

[Verse 2]
So clear, like the diamond in your ring
Cut to mirror your intention
Oversized, and overwhelmed
The shine of which has caught my eye

And rendered me so isolated
So motivated
I am certain now that
I am

[Chorus]
Vindicated, I am selfish, I am wrong
I am right, I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
The things you swore you saw yourself

[Bridge]
So turn up the corners of your lips
Part them and feel my fingertips
Trace the moment, fall forever
Defense is paper-thin
Just one touch, and I'd be in
Too deep now to ever swim against the current

So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip against the current

So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away
So let me slip away

[Chorus]
Vindicated, I am selfish, I am wrong
I am right, I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
The things you swore you saw yourself

[Outro]
Like hope dangles on a string
Like slow-spinning redemption"
ML1900,Carrie Underwood,Home Sweet Home,"[Verse 1]
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel
Left all alone

[Verse 2]
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

[Verse 3]
You know that I've seen
So many romantic dreams
Up in lights
Falling off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
It keeps me together at the seams

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home

ML1902,Janelle Monae,Cold War,"[Verse 1]
So you think I'm alone?
But being alone's the only way to be
When you step outside
You spend life fighting for your sanity

[Chorus]
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

[Verse 2]
If you want to be free
Below the ground is the only place to be
Cause in this life
You spend time running from depravity

This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for
This is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?

[Bridge]
Bring wing to the weak and bring grace to the strong
May all evil stumble as it flies in the world
All the tribes come and the mighty will crumble
We must brave this night and have faith in love

[Verse 3]
I'm trying to find my peace
I was made to believe there's something wrong with me
And it hurts my heart
Lord have mercy, ain't it plain to see?

But this is a cold war
Do you know what you're fighting for?
This is a cold war
You better know what you're fighting for

ML1904,Asobi Seksu,Thursday,"[Verse 1]
On gentle ground
I waited for you
In drops of dew
I wished they were you
With heavy hands
I reached out for you
My skin soaking wet
My eyes searched for you

[Chorus]
It seems you lost your way
You’ve let it all fall apart
Nothing’s left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we’ve lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me

[Verse 2]
With sharpened tongue
I cried out for you
And must I refrain
Now that I need you
The autumn wind feels
As if it were you
And swayed through the fields
Where I once held you

[Chorus]
It seems you lost your way
You’ve let it all fall apart
Nothing’s left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we’ve lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me

Whistle through your window
We act the same as you"
ML1905,Mastodon,Crusher Destroyer,"[Intro: T. rex roar from ""Jurassic Park""]

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Lesson
The honoring instinct of the animal
Pressure
No blame on the red bull
Throw fury at him
Aim, gorge and win
Less contenders on the way today
Let them pay
Nothing lost
Nothing gained
Suffer
Let them pay
Less contenders on the way today
Let them pay
Listen
Here lies the warning for matador
Blackout
Blood running the dirt floor
Won't bleed by accident

Burn your game plan"
ML1906,Symphony X,Serpent's Kiss,"[Verse 1]
Covenant of pure corruption
Sink my teeth deep into you
Solemn oath of sheer destruction
Nightmare, through and through

In that hour I'll devour
Hope is swallowed up in pain
Taste the venom, feel the power
Coursing through my veins

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm corruption
I'm destruction, through and through

[Chorus 1]
Trust in me
For I will set you free
With a serpent's kiss

With a serpent's kiss

[Verse 2]
Be my light and I won't stray, make me beg;
Make me pray
Tell me when to laugh or cry, when to live and when to die

[Bridge]
Forgotten and betrayed
Rotting and decayed
Left to wither without a voice
Left to slither without a choice

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Crucifier, spitting fire
Say your little empty prayers
This empire growing higher
To this spite, I swear

Sharp tongue severs like a razor
Swimming in a sea of rage
Vindicators, masqueraders
All the world's my stage

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I devour
I empower god of pain

[Chorus 2]
Trust in me for I will set you free
With a serpent's kiss
How could it come to this?
With a serpent's kiss"
ML1907,Keb' Mo',The Door,"I was down for so long
Everything I did was wrong
And I found fault
In everyone but me

I was hurt and alone
I could not find my way home
Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion

I was there by myself
Couldn't find no help no where else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there

Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

(Instrumental Bridge)
Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open"
ML1908,Lindsey Buckingham,Go Insane,"[Verse 1]
Two kinds of people in this world
Winners, losers
I lost my power in this world
'Cause I did not use it

[Chorus]
So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you

[Verse 2]
Two kinds of trouble in this world
Living, dying
I lost my power in this world
And the rumors are flying

[Chorus]
So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So I go insane
Like I always do
And I call your name
She's a lot like you

Like I always do

She's a lot like you
She's a lot like you"
ML1909,The Temper Trap,Love Lost,"[Verse 1]
Our love was lost
But now we've found it
Our love was lost, oh, lost
And hope was gone
Our love was lost
But now we've found it
And if you flash your heart, oh, heart
I won't deny it

[Chorus]
I promise
I promise

[Verse 2]
Your walls are up
Too cold to touch it
Your walls are up, oh, up
Too high to climb
I know it's hard
But I can still hear it beating
So if you flash your heart
I won't mistreat it

I promise
I promise

That you've, you've been dreaming of
Keep me in mind
When you're ready
I am here to take you every time

Oh, our love was lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost
Our love was lost
But now it's found"
ML1910,The Go! Team,Rolling Blackouts,"[Verse 1]
Over the range
The secret is what we became
But only the secret remains

Don't settle on me now
The cover is blown with a touch
We go when they're asking too much

[Chorus]
Got a history and it's catching up
Crossed the nation like a rolling blackout
Got the mystery but it's not enough
Ain't a prison but you'll never get out

Realise
Staying over is your only prize
Now I know
Some forget
But I don't

[Verse 2]
The road before us
We move on and never let out
The things we had whispered about

Back to the mirror now
There's nobody left to defend
Its here that my loyalty ends

[Chorus]
Got a history and it's catching up
Crossed the nation like a rolling blackout
Got the mystery but it's not enough
Ain't a prison but you'll never get out

Realise
Staying over is your only prize
Now I know
Some forgive
But I don't

[Outro]
No delay
Get out today
Get out if only I could
Letting go
I could say no
But I won't"
ML1911,Kaiser Chiefs,Oh My God,"[Verse 1]
Time on your side that will never end
The most beautiful thing you can ever spend
But you work in a shirt with your name tag on it
Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

[Bridge]
It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

[Verse 2]
Too much time spent dragging the past up
I didn't see you not looking when I messed up
Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

[Bridge]
It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

[Chorus]
Oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home

[Verse 3]
Great rulers make for greater glory
The only thing growing is our history
Knock me down I'll get right back up again
I'll come back stronger than a powered up Pac-Man

[Bridge]
It don't matter to me
Cause all I wanted to be
Was a million miles from here
Somewhere more familiar

Oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home

Oh my god I can't believe it
I've never been this far away from home
And oh my god I can't believe it

ML1912,Editors,No Sound But The Wind,"[Verse 1]
We can never go home
We no longer have one
I'll help you carry the load
I'll carry you in my arms
We walk through the ash
And the charred remains of our country
Keep an eye on my back
I'll keep an eye on the road

[Chorus]
Help me to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever

[Verse 2]
If I say, ""Shut your eyes""
If I say, ""Look away""
Bury your face in my shoulder
Think of a birthday
The things you put in your head
They will stay there forevеr
I'm trying hard to hide your soul, son
From things it's not meant to see

[Chorus]
Help mе to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever
Help me to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever, oh

If I say, ""Shut your eyes""
If I say, ""Shut your eyes""
Bury me in surprise
When I say, ""Shut your eyes, eyes""
Oh (Help me to carry the fire)
Oh
Oh (Help me to carry the fire)
Oh

Help me to carry the fire
To keep it alight together
Help me to carry the fire
This road won't go on forever"
ML1913,Tony Bennett,Lullaby Of Broadway ,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
A lullaby of Broadway

The rumble of the subway trains
The rattle of the taxis
The Daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby said good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies didn't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, babies
Sleep tight, let's call it a day, hey
Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway

The band began to go to town
And everything grew hazy
You rock-a-bye your baby round
To Ellington and Basie

When a Broadway baby said good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, babies
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
But listen to the lullaby of Broadway

Good night, babies
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
But listen to the lullaby of Broadway"

And thinks about the things we said

And takes the modern song she knows
But now and then a hollow ghost

And everything she says she can fall for
She goes on so no one will know

Everything that she says she can fall for
She knows she'll be there on her own

She goes on so no one will know

Everything she says she can fall for

A sad and a long lonely day
I walk the avenue
Hoping to run into
The very sight of you coming my way

I stop just in front of our door

I cry tears of goodbye

Til you come back to me

When you touched a friend of mine
I thought I would lose my mind
And I found out with time
That really I was not ready, no, no

Oh death
Oh death
Oh death
Really, I'm not ready

Oh death, you came to me
Decimate those dear to me
Teased me with your sweet release
You are full and you are constant
When my Mom was cancer sick
She fought, but then succumbed to it
But you made her beg for it

Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me
Maybe 'cause I'm hot to death, and I'm so, so, so sexy
All the boys, all the silly boys, they wanna fight over me
Every time I turn around, the boys fightin' over me
Every time I step out the house, they wanna fight over me

Up, and passin' the Hilton Suite, I'm still chasin' ya
Still patiently waitin', ma
Come lay off them Hampton guys and I'mma take ya to the x
Where them boys' lie
Play the corner all day, just plays cuz G's money
From deep all day, I'm straight swoosh
I'mma tie 'em at the Rucker, I'm at the Kanye ride
Doors up, doing donuts on the half court line
And any block we pass, niggas scream out crack
Yeah ma, you with the realest, how simple is that?
And you don't need him, you just need me
We can keep this on the low, we banned from TV
And he ain't gotta know, we ran through DC
Club Dreamin' ain't never be the same, we OD now
Dis is dis is your boy Joe Cook and this nigga all mad
'Cause his chick got took

She chose me, ever since the DJ announced 'em
And she got the right to
Low button down, or WSL shades, the ice is bright too
And I'm around Gomes, might as well let me get her
I promise to send her back tomorrow, 'round noon
Sore loser, but a good winner
Besides that she could use a little hood in her
A 40 from auto bond and a hood inner
You can bend her in the Range, back seat, at the center
Get violent, if money wanna try me

Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight

Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer, then move on ahead

Guides us with every first step

We clash with God's angels and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

Poder continuar
Si me dieras el adiós
Ya no estas y sigo de pie
Dios sabrá el porque
Tu adiós no me mato
Pero lo que logro
Fue llenarme de dolor
No muere el mundo sin ti
Pero lo hace gris
La luna saldrá
Mareas vendrán
Aunque no estés aquí
El tiempo su andar
No lo detendrá
Porque te has ido de mí
Mis heridas se olvidaran
Y la vida seguirá
No muere el mundo sin ti
Pero lo hace gris
Aun tengo que hacer
Y tengo salud
Y una breve sonrisa
Amigos veré los tengo lo se
Aunque solo seguiré
Y me prometí, olvidarme de ti
Fracasando al intentar
No muere el mundo sin ti
Pero lo hace gris
La luna saldrá
Mareas vendrán
Aunque no estés aquí
El tiempo su andar
No lo detendrá
Porque te has ido de mí
Mis heridas se olvidaran
Y la vida seguirá
No muere el mundo sin ti

[Verso 1]
A través de las persianas
De tu cuarto, de tu alma
Tú sientes como se filtra la nostalgia
Cuando cae la noche
Sobre tí, sobre tus hombros
Tú sabes como te duele estar aquí

[Puente 1]
Sin embargo
Ella está a tu lado
Un poco fría se volvió
Pero tú la estás amando

[Verso 2]
A través de las persianas
De tu mente, de tus recuerdos
Tú sientes como te oprimen esos sentimientos
Cuando cae el remordimiento
(Sobre ti, sobre tus manos)
Tú sabes como te duele haberlo hecho

[Puente 2]
Sin embargo
Ella está a tu lado
Nunca solo te dejó
Ni por un instante
En tu cuarto
Desde que tu la hiciste sufrir
Por su cuello tu la hiciste morir
Y no pudo nada ya decir
¡Ha!

ML1939,Ruben Blades,El Padre Antonio Y El Monaguillo Andres,"[Letra de ""El Padre Antonio y El Monaguillo Andrés""]

El Padre Antonio Xejeira vino de España
Buscando nuevas promesas en ésta tierra
Llegó a la selva sin la esperanza de ser obispo
Y entre el calor y entre los mosquitos habló de Cristo
El padre no funcionaba en el Vaticano
Entre papeles y sueños de aire acondicionado
Y fue a un pueblito, en medio e' la nada
A dar su sermón, cada semana, pa' los que busquen la salvación

El niño Andrés Eloy Pérez tiene 10 años
Y estudia en la elementaria ""Simón Bolívar""
Todavía no sabe decir el Credo correctamente
Le gusta el río, jugar al fútbol y estar ausente
Le han dado el puesto en la Iglesia de monaguillo
A ver si la conexión compone al chiquillo
Y su familia está muy orgullosa, porque a su vez se cree que
Con Dios conectando a uno, conecta a diez
Suenan la campanas, un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés
Suenan la campanas, un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés

El Padre condena la violencia
Sabe por experiencia que no es la solución
Les habla de amor y de justicia
De Dios va la noticia vibrando en su sermón
Suenan las campanas, un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés
Suenan las campanas otra vez
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés

Y al Padre lo halló la guerra un domingo de misa
Dando la Comunión en manga de camisa
En medio de un Padre Nuestro entró el Matador
Y sin confesar su culpa le disparó
Antonio cayó, ostia en mano
Y sin saber por qué
Andrés se murío a su lado sin conocer a Pelé;
Y entre el grito y la sorpresa, agonizando otra vez
Estaba el Cristo
De palo pegado a la pared
Y nunca se supo el criminal quién fue
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés
Pero suenan las campanas otra vez
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés

Suenan las campanas"

Alright
C'mon

Enslaved by warlords from far away lands
Forced into a life of slavery
Forced to fight your brothers for rulers so cruel
A killer instinct your only escape
Ferocious battle, you must fight to survive

[Chorus: Cam Pipes & Jamie Hooper, Cam Pipes]
Each weapon an extension of your strength
All victories add greatness to your name

[Verse 2: Jamie Hooper & Cam Pipes]
Fight to the death, there will be no surrender
Your cunning must be afforded
There will be no remorse for those who gamble with your fate
Freedom, through killing strangers will it come
You fight to live, freedom gained with every shiv

[Chorus: Cam Pipes]
You need to prove, prove your worth
To ascend to the trial of champions

Every fight a battle to the death
Your fate lies in the hands of fools
A meager wager more precious than your life

ML1942,Serena Ryder,Little Bit Of Red,"Hey you, say you wanna start over again
Like I ever wanted it to be any different
I've been watching all your colors fade to blue

Said you'd come back like I want you, want you
Stop pretending everything's all right, oh

Baby blue, oh, baby blue
Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Your black and white needs a little bit of red, ooh

Couldn't handle pressure life had put you through
Thought you might have bit a little more than you could chew
No, I don't believe it when you say I will make it up to you

Said you'd come back, didn't want you to, want you to
Still pretending everything's alright, oh

Baby blue, oh, baby blue
Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red
Your black and white needs a little bit of red

Baby blue, oh, oh
Baby blue, oh, oh

Oh, baby blue, oh, baby blue
Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red

Come here, I'm gonna smear another color over you
Get out of bed, you little sleepy head
Your black and white needs a little bit of red

ML1943,Patty Griffin,You'll Remember,"Maybe one day
Along the way
You'll remember me
On this island

Smiling at you
How I used to
Maybe one day
You'll remember

And it won't be sad
To think of all we had
All unhappy ends
Will be behind us then

Maybe one day
Along the way
You'll think of me
And you'll be smiling

Maybe one day
Maybe one day
Maybe one day
You'll remember"

Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right

Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

ML1945,Kirk Whalum,Inside ,"Butterflies before they fly
They never doubt the beauty that awaits inside
Like a flower reaching out, reaching for the sun
They don't compare theirselves to anyone
And I wonder why we do

So don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

In your eyes, I see your light
Shining from your heart when you don't even try
So just be yourself 'cause there's no one else
No one else like you, there ain't nobody in this world it's true
So let your light come through

So don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside
Beauty is inside

There's more than what meets the eye
Much more than on the outside
It's something that's deep inside
You won't find it on a movie screen or pages of a magazine
Much more than the eye can see

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child
Beauty is inside

Don't try too hard now, be who you are now
You've got to let it shine
Beauty has no face, no color, no race child

Y después lloraremos los dos

Y después lloraremos los dos
Porque siempre así pasa
Cuando no hay remedio

Love is a razor, and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If I could only see her now

Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, and
Balancing on a ledge, and
Balancing on a ledge, and
Living on a razor's edge

The evil that men do lives on and on...

At an end, it seems
The seventh lamb slain
The book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you
Someday, I may return
Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn

Counter attack with the melody, love all your enemies, this is the remedy
Counter attack or fall back, fight fire with water, put the fire out"

This girl walked in dreams
Playing in a world of her own
This girl was a child
Existing in a playground of stone
Then one night her world was changed
Her life and dreams were rearranged
And she would never be the same again

This girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about
And she's learning, learning to live

She cried a single tear, a teardrop that was sweet and warm
Our hearts told us we were right
And on that sweet and velvet night
A child had died, a woman had been born

This girl is a woman now, and she's learning how to give
This girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about

ML1965,K'Naan,Fire In Freetown,"[Verse 1]
There's no way to write it, there's no way to fight it
And I kick and scream but you got me despite it
And I got my pride so I begin to hide it
Like fire in Freetown you begin to light it

[Hook]
Aha ha Aha ha, sidii hogasha roobka
Aha ha Aha ha, you shine down upon me
Aha ha Aha ha, sidii hogasha roobka
Aha ha Aha ha, you shine down upon me

[Verse 2]
By some higher order, you keep getting bolder
By God or by country you kill like a soldier
By some riddle you sung little, but scream mighty stronger
Like fire in Freetown, you old magic spoiler

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You place pins in my ribs and ask me to lie down
My pain is your pleasure but pleasure is all mine
You lend me your false ear, I'll lend you my false line
Like fire in Freetown, I'm fueled by your gold mine

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Fire fire!
Fire fire, She pulled out her match and she burned down my home
Fire fire, She always can find me, she know where I roam
Fire fire, She know where to touch me to turn me to stone
Fire fire, She come like a storm and she rain on my lawn
Fire fire, She know where to touch me to rune me to stone
Fire fire, She always can find me, she know where I roam
Fire fire, She pulled out her match and she burned down my home"
ML1966,Dead Confederate,Run From The Gun,"I got mad at history
Picked it up and fell in love with everything
Men and pen and paper
Like the wind you let 'em in now they'll never leave
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun where the dead lay
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun...
You were sweet as poison
Dried my mouth took me out and left me glad
You did me no favors
It was dumb and the last one that I ever had
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun where the dead lay
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun...
It was loaded with the pressure
Too much pressure to be measured
I was holding off the wrong and the right...
I got let down gently
Never even knew the end was on the way
Then I made my peace there
Opened eyes and my surprise it was a waste
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun where the dead lay
Run from the gun don't be afraid
Run from the gun.."
ML1967,Love Is All,Bigger Bolder,"Faster, louder, my love for you
Bigger, bolder, my love for you
There's no sense trying to make this smart
I simply hate every minute that we're apart

Taller, stronger, my love for you
Whiter, brighter, my love for you
There's no point trying to sound smart
I simply hate every minute that we're apart

Hotter, wetter
Larger, longer
No no no there's no sense trying to make this smart
I simply hate every minute that we're apart"
ML1968,The Raveonettes,Heart Of Stone,"I get away just for a while
I get to pine I get to cry
Being without you
You think my world is tumbling down

You know the reason I can't hurt
I got a heart of stone

I went away to meet my love
I saw things that I can't have
It makes me mad
To think of you with someone else

You know the reason I can't hurt
I got a heart of stone

I get away just for a while
I get to pine I get to cry
Being without you
You think my world is tumbling down

You know the reason I can't hurt
I got a heart of stone"
ML1969,The Smiths,London,"[Verse 1]
Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train, heave on to Euston

[Chorus]
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?
Ohh

[Verse 2]
You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?

[Chorus]
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

[Verse 3]
You've left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that ""When he goes, he really goes""

[Chorus]
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?"
ML1970,Jeru The Damaja,D. Original,"[Verse 1]
Dirty rotten scoundrel, that's what I'm called on the street
Could connive and cheat but rarely get beat
Ya see I'm streetwise, a con-game pro
Kickin' the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo
Not stressin' five-o, hot hand in cee-lo
Live in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough
Homicide central, East New York
Where the manic depressive psycho murderers stalk
Walk like a ninja on the asphalt
Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk
And there's more hardtimes than on Good Times
And most niggas dedicate their life to crime
So I'm steady schemin', won't work for a dime
Used to get tax free loot all the time
Type slick can't fess on 'Ru because
I'm the original dirty rotten scoundrel

[Verse 2]
Before trains were graffiti proof I used to get loose
Dirty rotten since the days of the deuce
Dirty because of the skin I'm in, the fact I have -
Melanin automatically makes me a felon
Even though I'm righteous rotten's what you're yellin'
But I'm not chain-snatchin', or drug-sellin'
According to your books you said I would be damned like Ham
Scoundrel, opposite of the king that I am
You wanna get funny? We can get bummy
Take you to the East and back again money
Filthy putrefied trick, step past your sister
Challenge the Damaja, and you'll be his-to-
Ry, Mortal Kombat fatality
The Original, don't sing no R&B
Nasty emcee deity, chop off domes -
With the poems that come out of my pi-ne-al
Gland, as I expand you know who I am

[Verse 3]
Father of all stylin', I be wildin' on wax
We hack shit up like big ax and little ax
Don't need toast to make you jump like bungee
Tracks real muddy like Brooklyn's, real grungy
When I come through I clog up your sewer
Peep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure
So bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter
No matter what you do you can't get through the Crud that comes out of your system
You're another victim of Dirty Rotten
Dirt up in your grill, so what ya gonna do
But pay homage to (homage to, homage to)..."
ML1971,Phyllis Hyman,"Loving You, Losing You","[Verse 1]
In the middle of my life, I had nothing to lose
No one to love, now it's you I'm thinking of
You're a little of heaven to me
You're all I need, it's my concern
There's a lesson to be learned
I thought I had the whole world at my feet
Now I know
That I was dreaming
I fooled around and lost the only one made for me
And now I'm sorry, oh so sorry

[Chorus]
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing, losing your love

[Verse 2]
You can label a man worth having, it's up to me
This heart of mine has to live a second time
Take a little of your love from me
And I'll be gone
Your love to me is like honey to a bee
I stand accused of being what I am
I'm a fool and now I know it
This episode is ready to unfold
How can I begin to write a brand new story

[Chorus]
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Oh, losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
(I don't wanna lose you)
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
(I love you, yes I do)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you
Loving you isn't worth the pain of losing you
Losing you isn't worth the pain of loving you"
ML1972,Neko Case,Lady Pilot,"What?

Stars can't fight city lights
They've turned their backs on us
It's true today, I saw it from the plane
Aeroplanes were never built to fly

Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Don't look down
Don't look now

Crosshairs of our shadow trace the dam
Told that there were people trapped alive
Boulder City looks like coals in the fire

Cabin's perched by satellites
And now we're flying blind
We've got a lady pilot
She's not afraid to die

It's true today, I saw it from the plane
We've almost finished reeling in the sky
Power lines once laced the heavens
Pima County looks like coals in the fire"
ML1973,Jonathan Richman,I Was The One She Came For,"She could have had them all
Wasn't I too tame for her
That meteor?
But I was the one she came for

I was all smoke and haze
And then a flame for her
That hurricane
Hurricane, when she came for me
Hurricane, when she came

She had power, she had soul
And things they don't have a name for
I had to ask myself
Was I game for her?

I thought that I was through
She thought that wasn't true
Oh, she had things to do
I was the one she came for
Hurricane, when she came

She saw me on the fly
She knew me with one eye
I walked her 'round the block
And nothing's been the same for me

I thought I'd seen a lot
She proved that I had not
And I needed what she brought
And it was a hurricane when she came for me
A hurricane when she came

I was the one she came for
Hurricane, when she came

Hurricane, when she, hurricane, when she
Hurricane when she came for me
I was the one she, I was the one she
I was the one she came for, yeah"

A thousand ways to woo a lover so sincere

You were my inspiration

I often think of you night and day
But I know that someday, someday darling
I won't be trouble no more

Trouble, trouble and misery
Is about to get the best of me
But I know that someday, oh someday darling
I won't be trouble no more

About you leaving baby, you know that's wrong

ML1977,Brett Dennen,Dancing At A Funeral,"Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day

Strange, but not surprisin', nor is it unfamiliar
How it takes a death like this to bring us together
You know you'll always be my flesh and blood;
I could never do you wrong
And the one who was gone for so long is coming home

Alright...

Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying;
We are laughing and we're crying every single day

We are getting older at the blink of an eye
So, don't let the moment pass you by
I don't believe there is a greater love, one of patience and pain
Than the love between a mama and her children

In the procession down to the lighthouse
We hear the crashing of the waves, and the mistakes we made
You know that we are not the only ones, so, we can have some fun
Have some, have some, have some, have some fun

Now's not the time to be so sad and mournful
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying;
We are laughing and we're crying every single day
Every single day

[Is] not the time to be so, to be so sad
We are going to the funeral and we'll be dancing the night away
So, so, so, don't be so shy, we are living and we're dying
We are laughing and we're crying every single day
Every single day"

There's no one coming (There's no one coming)
And there's no way out (And there's no way out)
I've been falling (Well I've been falling)
And it's so far down

Shrouded beneath a veil of tragedy
When death comes calling, who will you believe?
Tell me who would you believe
When it's down to you and me
Will you still stay on your knees?
Who will you believe
When it's down to you and me?

Fear can stop you loving
Love can stop your fear
Fear can stop you loving

I always try so hard
To share my self around
But now I'm closing up again
Drilling through the ground

Fear can stop you loving

There's a prophet on a mountain and he's makin' up dinner
With long division and a riding crop
Anybody can feel like a winner when it's served up piping hot
But the people aren't lookin' for a handout
They're America's working corps
Can this be what they voted for?

[Chorus: Greg Graffin]
Let them eat war (Ah, ah-ah, ah)
Let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war (Ah, ah-ah, ah)
Let them eat war
There's an urgent need to feed
Declining pride

[Verse 2: Greg Graffin]
From the force to the union shops
The war economy is makin' new jobs
But the people who benefit most
Are breakin' bread with their benevolent hosts
Who never stole from the rich to give to the poor
All they ever gave to them was a war
And a foreign enemy to deplore

[Chorus: Greg Graffin]
Let them eat war (Ah, ah-ah, ah)
Let them eat war
That's how to ration the poor
Let them eat war (Ah, ah-ah, ah)
Let them eat war

Declining pride

[Interlude: Sage Francis]
We've got to kill 'em and eat 'em before they reach for their checks
Squeeze some blue collars, let them bleed from their necks
Seize a few dollars from the people who sweat
'Cause it's freedom or debt, and they won't question it
At a job site, the boss is godlike
Conditioned workhorses park at a stoplight
Seasoned vets with their feet in nets
A stone's throw away from a rock fight
But not tonight

[Bridge: Greg Graffin, Sage Francis, Both]
(Feed 'em death) Here comes another ration
(Feed 'em death) 'Cause they're the finest in the nation
(Feed 'em death) But there's nothing left to feed 'em with
'Cause it's freedom, or it's death

[Chorus: Greg Graffin]

Holy flames that have once come alive

I've been betrayed, but now cross my line
Reborn to thrive
Cut 'em down, storming the hive

ML1990,Testament,Apocalyptic City ,"[Instrumental Intro]

Born into a world of hatred
Nothing to live for
What started with a simple match
Turned into something more
The pain I felt inside my head
Came on my day of birth
Now the time has come for me
To burn the planet Earth

I can feel the fire burn inside of me
The power's at my fingers, waiting you shall see

Burn, ignite the population
Burn, causing mass cremation
Burn, feel no shame or pity
Burn, apocalyptic city

Years have passed as I stood still
To plan the final blow
I'll make the town go up in flames
A hellish death they'll know
As I pour on the gasoline
I listen deep inside
I hear the cries of all my victims
Nowhere to run or hide

I can feel the fire burn inside of me
The power's at my fingers, waiting you shall see

Burn, ignite the population
Burn, causing mass cremation
Burn, feel no shame or pity
Burn, apocalyptic city

[Instrumental Break]

Now my great assault is over
And my life is done
Staring at my great inferno
Was my only fun
So I leave you with my tale
I hear my conscious fall
A victim of myself
So now I'll end it all

I can feel the fire burn inside of me
The power's at my fingers, waiting you shall see

Burn, ignite the population
Burn, causing mass cremation
Burn, feel no shame or pity
Burn, apocalyptic city

[Short Instrumental Break]

Burn!

ML1991,The Sex Pistols,Liar,Lyrics not found
ML1992,Unearth,Endless,"Shadow of doubt consumes you
The light you barely see
Growing wings of sorrow
Have brought you to the winds of plague
Increscent boundaries fade the way
A barren future all too real
And still I try to seek up and find the flame
And still I try inside
It's endless

A barren future all too real
And still I try
Endless fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Endless tragedy
Endless lunacy

Chalk up the past as a memory
This battering sickness has surely won
Chalk up the past as a memory
This battering sickness has surely won

All I have wasted
Will this erase me
All I have wasted
Will wash away
All I have wasted
Will this erase me
All I have wasted
Will this erase me
Wash Away
Time to clean my wounds

Can I win this battle inside and out
Can I win this battle inside-out

Endless fight
Fight
Fight
Fight
Endless tragedy
Endless lunacy
Lunacy"
ML1993,Iron Maiden,Fear Of The Dark,"[Verse 1]
I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night, or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 2]
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 3]
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around, and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
[Instrumental Break 3:15-4:58]

[Bridge]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

[Verse 4]
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone"
ML1994,30 Seconds To Mars,Search And Destroy,"[Verse 1]
Grab your gun, time to go to hell
I'm no hero guilty as charged
Search and destroy

Found my faith, living in sin
I'm no Jesus, but neither are you my friend
I'm a whore, a birth of broken dreams
This simple answer is never what it seems

[Chorus]
A million little pieces we've broken into
A million little pieces I've stolen from you
Search and destroy, search and destroy
Search and destroy, search and destroy

[Verse 2]
Sold my soul, to heaven and to hell
Sick as my secrets, but never gonna tell
Love to blame, burden of my dreams
A curse of faith and a blessing I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe (A million little pieces)
I believe

[Chorus]
Search and destroy, search and destroy
Search and destroy, search and destroy
Search and destroy

Let go, let go

ML1998,Lair Of The Minotaur,Evil Power,"At the dawn of violence
The Telkhine wizards met
On the peat of Mt. Cithren
They vowed malevolence
The call for death was sent
To command all earth and men
Behead the mega priest
Bring hell unto the streets
I hear voices
Make me kill
I hear voices
Make me kill
Evil Power
Evil Power
Evil Power
On the wings of malcontent
Another billion dead
Upon your bated breath
Their calculated death
Demonic influence
Completely pulls me in
Our fists raised to the sky
As we watch the Goddess die
I hear voices
Make me kill
I hear voices
Slaughter
Evil Power
Evil Power
Evil Power"
ML1999,Jimmy Ruffin,I've Passed This Way Before,"Life lends a crushing blow
And once again a heart is broken
And as history repeats itself
These few words are sadly spoken

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same
Once again heartache has found me

A dark cloud covered my heart
Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again

No matter how strong a man is
Without love he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart

A lonely journey now stands before me
The endless pain has started
But this time I know the way
Walking alone and broken hearted

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny

Because I've passed this way before
And I've felt this pain before
A hurt that took so long to end
Has found my poor heart again"
ML2000,High On Fire,Bastard Samurai,"Count my fingers ten
Dressed to kill and think again
Count my fingers nine
Do the math your sacrifice
Son of a bitch should bleed awhile

Fighting under style
Sleeping under death awhile
Gladiators ring
Sharpening my blade to sting
Son of a bitch, your fate I'll bring

Profit melee are all mesmerized
All betray the bastard samurai
Profit melee on this killing floor
All betray the bastard samurai

[Solo]

Bastard samurai
Bastard samurai

The killer I've become
Tattoo heart yakuza's thumb
Killing men aside
Severed heads abide
Son of a bitch should bleed awhile

Bastard samurai
Bastard samurai"
