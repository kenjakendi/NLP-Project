sad,Black theatre of love Violet dancers cast their blood The moon gave me flowers For funerals to come 12 shapes bow before her I am still one of them 12 morbid ways to die Her beauty scares me I'm falling deeper No more pain to feel now Touch the silence Afraid of hell Black theatre of love Violet dancers drink my blood The moon gave me flowers For funerals to come I cannot breathe I am losing life The moon paints the skyline blue She died so beautiful

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face His shoes are a terrible disgrace He's got no manners when he eats his food He's fat and lazy and extremely rude But if you don't care a feather or a fig You may grow up to be a pig  Or would you like to swing on a star Carry moonbeams home in a jar And be better off than you are Or would you rather be a fish?  A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook He can't write his name or read a book To fool the people is his only thought And though he's slippery, he still gets caught But then if that sort of life is what you wish You may grow up to be a fish  And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo Everyday you'll meet quite a few So you see it's all up to you You can be better than you are You could be swingin' on a star"

sad," I woke up cryin' late at night, when I was very young I had dreamed my father, had passed away and gone My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore So I made my way down, the mirrored hall, and tapped upon his door   And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid! How would I go on, with you gone that way? Don't wanna cry anymore, so may I stay with you?"" And he said ""That's my job, that's what I do Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me That's my job, you see.""   Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams We each held for me He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west I said ""I could make it out there, if I just had the fare I got half, will you loan me the rest?""   And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid There's no guarantee in the plans I've made And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?"" And he said ""That's my job, that's what I do Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me That's my job, you see.""   Every person carves his spot, and fills the hole with life And I pray someday I might, light as bright as he   Woke up early one bright fall day, read the tragic news After all my travels, I settled down, within a mile or two I make my livin' with words and rhymes, and all this tragedy Should go into my head and out instead, as bits of poetry   But I say, ""Daddy I'm so afraid How will I go on, with you gone this way How can I come up, with a song to say, ""I love you."" ""That's my job, that's what I do Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me That's my job, you see.""   ""Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me."""

sad," I can take a road Takes a little longer Walk before the house where we had our games Suffering life, play, making, we discovered fire People like you made me so much stronger People like you made me question blame Huddled in strength like birds on a sloping wire   Hearing your voice makes me so uneasy Hearing your voice makes me question fame Money is deaf to the sound of a lover's cry   The language of loss made me so much older The language of loss made me lose my grip The language of loss made me silent as a newborn child 'cause everything moves in a shifting cycle The unison soars and the pressure dips Making our way steadfast in the skyward mile   And baby I know I will see you someday Building your house on the very street You severed your mother's life from your father's land Finish your home we can join them this way We talked about peace and a little dream Marriage and love and divorce we don't understand   And you know I have to sway my leaves and branches slowly Out in the sun, like the silent shout of youth And we ask why do we take these leaps and chances Because we have no choice but to wither into truth   And I dreamed you were there All the vital signs were standing When I dreamed you were with me With the summer at my back And I dreamed you were there So complete and undemanding We know the love that gives Is what the living always lack  "

What can I do?  I will scream in your ear As you're passing by I will wrap my arms around you You won't hear, you won't feel me I will walk stride for stride with you I will try to help When you stumble You will stumble through me  I have become the invisible man It's all I am Invisible  I have read all your letters I know what you contain I have dreamt your dreams My head.. My head is haunted I will scream again ""I am perfectly sane"" ""I am perfectly sane"" But I am The invisible man I am The invisible man  Talk to me Acknowledge me Confide in me Confess to me ... or Leave me be Leave me be"

She knew that, sooner or later, they would realize that the ride wasn't stopping and they were all going to die"

With thankful heart and joyful mind The shepherds went the Babe to find And as God's angel had foretold They did our Saviour Christ behold Within a manger He was laid And by his side the Virgin Maid As long foretold upon that morn There was a blessed Messiah born"

Is it something new? Are we finally to something new?"

They say Hell hath no furies Like a woman scorned by life When the Heavenly Judge and juries Participate to chain this wife With forced virtue, Her secret needs On warm we nights, with storm-wracked bites I gave her Eden after the flood  Written in the dead of night And riding on the burning wind Smitten by her read delight My words alight like leaves of sin  Verona, Marishka, Aleera Brides of old and goddesses all Forgive my wishes to be always near her Forever or whenever seas recall  The Aphrodite from my embrace For as Mars (whom her lips placate) I tore these shores with wars of hatred Before our Paris wet his fate In Helen, one might find mistake In winning tragedy For all eternity...

happy," In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town Two acres of field and a gas station Riding on my moped, looking for fun Staring into the blood red sun On the country road is a boulevard With neon lights and night open bars In my jacket a pack of playing cards Just jacks, jokers, and the queen of hearts   My heart is beating Beating like Ringo As I pull into the drive-in bingo   Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city? When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts and saggy jeans all covered in dirt I want the people in the country to be open and kind But most times I've met those with a narrow mind With a big black dog to bite your behind If they ever find out you're not one of their kind   All these thoughts as I open up a Zingo Friday night at the drive-in bingo   So this is what they do out here for fun? They play bingo and let their engines run? Tonight's jackpot is a pig, hey that's criminal! G-42! Ooh, I'm going diagonal! I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends As many fits into an army tent Just bring our savings and a bottle of wine To the Friday night's reversal of time!   This little south-west village shouldn't cost that much Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge And the windmill's perfect for movies and such We could fake our deaths to get insurance money And take on hippie names I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny We could start a little farm with little white bunnies Just because watching them copulate is very funny There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you! A glass of apple cider just waiting for you! The smell of 1952 just waiting for you! And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you...   A daydream, I'm caught up in limbo Friday night at the drive-in bingo"

sad," I remember a girl so very well The carnival drums all mad in the air Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell O where do we go now but nowhere In a colonial hotel  we fucked up the sun And then we fucked it down again Well the sun comes up and the sun goes down Going round and round to nowhere The kitten that padded and purred on my lap Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear I turn the other cheek and you lay into that O where do we go now but nowhere   O wake up, my love, my lover wake up O wake up, my love, my lover wake up   Across clinical benches with nothing to talk Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer While the bones of our child crumble like chalk O where do we go now but nowhere I remember a girl so bold and so bright Loose-limbed and laughing and brazen and bare Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light O where do we go now but nowhere You come for me now with a cake that you've made Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair Full of glass and bleach and my old razorblades O where do we go now but nowhere   O wake up, my love, my lover wake up O wake up, my love, my lover wake up   If they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air Behind the locked gates an old donkey moans O where do we go now but nowhere Around the duck pond we grimly mope Gloomily and mournfully we go rounds again And one more doomed time and without much hope Going round and around to nowhere From the balcony we watched the carnival band The crack of the drum a little child did scare I can still feel his fingers pressed in my hand O where do we go now but nowhere If I could relive one day of my life If I could relive just a single one You on the balcony, my future wife O who could have known, but no one   O wake up, my love, my lover make up O wake up, my love, my lover make up"

sad,"You just have to be sure you're doing the right thing. I mean it's very easy to forget - she was just sitting there in the pub with her new friends and her new life and her new hair, and it might have been five years but you'd know just to look at her I wasn't even sure it was her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our  new birds She said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out But you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week You can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on. And you'll know you've done the right thing"

relaxed, The night sets softly With the hush of falling leaves Casting shivering shadows On the houses through the trees And the light from a street lamp Paints a pattern on my wall Like the pieces of a puzzle Or a child's uneven scrawl   Up a narrow flight of stairs In a narrow little room As I lie upon my bed In the early evening gloom Impaled on my wall My eyes can dimly see The pattern of my life And the puzzle that is me   From the moment of my birth To the instant of my death There are patterns I must follow Just as I must breathe each breath Like a rat in a maze The path before me lies And the pattern never alters Until the rat dies   And the pattern still remains On the wall where darkness fell And it's fitting that it should For in darkness I must dwell Like the color of my skin Or the day that I grow old My life is made of patterns That can scarcely be controlled

There is no more mystery Is it going to happen, my love?

But you are the real evil beast! You, who damned nature's dearest child He cries his sorrow to the moon A tear shines through the misty gloom Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?
