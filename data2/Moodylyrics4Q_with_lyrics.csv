And there ain't no way to sweep up the mess that we've made She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed Flowers for the sick and dead She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes and when the fog rises somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore There's nothing to keep you from falling in love. It starts at the bottom and comes from above. Like pieces of a puzzle, like a hand in a glove She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed Flowers for the sick and dead She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow She'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes and when the tide rises somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye"

Today was the day but she threw it all away and I could never understand 'cause she was never one to play by the rules of the game her and me we're so the same. I try so hard and I never give in, and I am never satisfied until the day that I win against them. But I don't care I'll follow her to anywhere.
